## ABOUT THIS GUIDE

After thirty-two years in the provisioning business, I've learned that feeding people well is about more than just buying food. It's about understanding seasons, storage, trade routes, and the fundamental economics of keeping people alive and healthy.

This guide represents everything I wish someone had taught me when I started. No romantic nonsense about "culinary artistry" - this is practical knowledge for people who need to feed armies, stock taverns, or provision adventuring parties without going broke or poisoning anyone.

## WHO THIS GUIDE IS FOR

**Tavern Keepers & Innkeepers**
You need reliable suppliers, proper storage knowledge, and the ability to calculate costs per serving. This guide will help you stock your kitchen efficiently and avoid the mistakes that bankrupt establishments.

**Army Quartermasters**
Feeding hundreds or thousands requires understanding bulk pricing, storage life, and nutritional basics. You'll find practical advice for large-scale provisioning and field rations.

**Adventuring Parties**
Weight matters when you're carrying everything. This guide covers lightweight, long-storage provisions that won't spoil in your pack or weigh you down.

**Ship's Provisioners**
Months at sea require careful planning. Learn what stores well, what prevents scurvy, and how to calculate water and food needs for extended voyages.

**Noble House Stewards**
Your employers expect variety and quality. This guide covers specialty items, seasonal availability, and the difference between everyday provisions and luxury ingredients.

**Anyone Who Feeds People**
Whether it's a family, a monastery, or a merchant caravan, the principles are the same: buy smart, store properly, and don't waste money on spoilage.

---

## WHAT MAKES THIS GUIDE DIFFERENT

**Honest Pricing**
I list real Waterdeep market prices as of 1492 DR. Prices vary by season and region, but these give you a baseline for negotiations.

**Mathematical Accuracy**
Every weight-to-uses calculation is verified. When I say a 10-pound sack provides 100 uses, the math is correct. No guesswork.

**Storage Reality**
I tell you actual storage times, not optimistic fantasy. Fresh milk spoils in 1-2 days. Whole grains last 1-3 years. Plan accordingly.

**Safety First**
Poisoning your customers is bad for business and often illegal. I include warnings about toxic foods, proper preparation requirements, and identification guidelines for foraged items.

**Regional Integration**
All items are connected to real locations in the Sword Coast and beyond. Goldenfields wheat, Trielta Hills garlic, Waterdeep imports - you'll know where things come from and why that matters.

**No Nonsense**
I don't waste your time with flowery descriptions. You'll get practical information: what it costs, how much you need, how to store it, and what to look for when buying.

## UNDERSTANDING RARITY TIERS

Items are organized by rarity, which correlates with price and availability:

**Common** - Available in most markets year-round. Basic necessities.
*Examples: Yellow onions, wheat flour, common ale, button mushrooms*

**Uncommon** - Specialty items or seasonal goods. Available but more expensive.
*Examples: Shallots, specialty flours, fine wine, shiitake mushrooms*

**Rare** - Limited availability, regional specialties, or items requiring special sourcing.
*Examples: Black garlic, ancient grain varieties, ice wine, wild morels*

**Very Rare** - Difficult to obtain, often magical properties. Very expensive.
*Examples: Magical grains, phoenix tears, ethereal salt, rare magical beverages*

**Legendary** - Mythological or divine items. Usually not available for purchase.
*Examples: Tears of Selûne, Ambrosia, Waters of Life*

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLES FOR PROVISIONERS

### 1. **Quality Over Quantity**
One good apple sustains better than three poor ones. Buy from reliable sources, inspect carefully, and don't compromise on quality to save a few coppers.

### 2. **Know Your Suppliers**
Build relationships with honest merchants. A supplier who warns you about a bad harvest is more valuable than one who always tells you everything is perfect.

### 3. **Proper Storage Is Half the Job**
The best ingredients in the world are worthless if you let them spoil. Learn storage requirements and follow them religiously.

### 4. **Calculate Real Costs**
The cheapest price per pound isn't always the best deal if half of it spoils before you use it. Factor in waste, storage costs, and preparation time.

### 5. **Seasonal Planning**
Prices swing dramatically with seasons. Buy root vegetables in fall when they're cheap. Pay premium prices for fresh berries in winter or skip them entirely.

### 6. **Regional Variation Matters**
A pineapple costs 10 gold in Waterdeep, might be 2 silver in Maztica, and is unobtainable in Icewind Dale. Know your trade routes.

### 7. **When in Doubt, Verify**
If something seems too cheap, too good, or too magical, verify it. Test water before buying barrels. Cast *Detect Magic* on supposedly enchanted items. Your reputation depends on selling genuine products.

### 8. **Safety Is Not Optional**
Never forage mushrooms without expert identification. Always boil questionable water. Warn customers about allergens. A dead customer is bad for business and often lands you in legal trouble.

## A NOTE ON MAGICAL ITEMS

This guide includes magical provisions - items with genuine supernatural properties. These range from common (minor healing herbs) to legendary (divine ambrosia).

**Important warnings:**
- Magical items command premium prices for good reason
- Fakes are epidemic - verify with *Detect Magic* before purchasing
- Some magical foods have dangerous side effects
- Divine items (tears, ambrosia, ichor) are usually not legitimately available for purchase
- Your reputation depends on selling authentic magical goods

If someone offers you Elverquisst at 5 gold instead of 50, it's fake. If someone has Phoenix Tears for sale in bulk, report them to authorities. Use your head.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Thanks to the quartermaster from Neverwinter who politely pointed out I'd somehow published five editions without a grains section. Embarrassing, but he was absolutely right.

Thanks to the mushroom forager who stopped me from selling death caps as portobello mushrooms in my second year. That would have been a very short career.

Thanks to every supplier who warned me about bad harvests, every customer who complained about spoiled goods (teaching me better storage), and every competitor who kept me honest.

And thanks to the Waterdeep Merchant's Guild for maintaining standards that actually mean something.
