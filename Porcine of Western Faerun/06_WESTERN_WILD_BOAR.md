# WESTERN WILD BOAR
## Dangerous Game & Trophy Hunting

*Wild boar aren't livestock - they're CR 1 encounters that fight back. A charging boar can gore a grown man, break bones, and keep fighting after taking multiple arrow hits. Hunting boar requires preparation, teamwork, and respect for a dangerous opponent. But succeed? 300+ pounds of gamey, flavorful meat, valuable tusks, thick hide, and bragging rights. This is hunting, not farming.*

## QUICK STATS (CREATURE)

**Challenge Rating:** 1 (200 XP)

**Size:** Medium beast

**Typical Weight:** 280-350 lbs (mature boars), 180-250 lbs (sows), 100-180 lbs (juveniles)

**Habitat:** Dense forests, hills, scrubland (Western Heartlands, Sword Coast, The North)

**Behavior:** Aggressive when threatened, territorial, travel in groups (sounders)

**Population:** Common in wild areas, controlled near settlements (hunting pressure)

**Hunting Season:** Year-round (pest control), Fall optimal (fattened on mast)

**Recommended Party:** 3-5 adventurers OR 2-3 experienced hunters with dogs

---

## COMBAT STATISTICS (D&D 5E)

### **WILD BOAR**

**Armor Class:** 11 (natural hide)

**Hit Points:** 11 (2d8 + 2)

**Speed:** 40 ft.

---

**STR** | **DEX** | **CON** | **INT** | **WIS** | **CHA**
13 (+1) | 11 (+0) | 12 (+1) | 2 (-4) | 9 (-1) | 5 (-3)

---

**Senses:** Passive Perception 9

**Languages:** —

**Challenge:** 1 (200 XP)

---

### **TRAITS**

**Charge.** If the boar moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 3 (1d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If the boar takes 7 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.

---

### **ACTIONS**

**Tusk.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) slashing damage.

---

### **TACTICAL NOTES**

**Opening Charge:**
Wild boar prefer **charge attack** from cover/ambush:
- Move 20+ feet (usually 30-40 feet at full sprint)
- Tusk attack (1d6+1) + charge bonus (1d6) = **2d6+1 total damage**
- Strength save DC 11 or knocked prone
- **Average damage on charge: 8 damage + prone** (significant threat to low-level characters)

**Relentless Ability:**
If boar takes ≤7 damage that would kill it, **survives at 1 HP instead**:
- Single-attack kills difficult (11 HP + Relentless = functionally 18+ HP against single strikes)
- **Requires focused fire or multi-attack** to reliably drop
- Wounded boar at 1 HP = STILL DANGEROUS (full attack capability)

**Group Tactics:**
Boar travel in sounders (groups):
- **Sounder size:** 2-8 boar (1 dominant male, 1-3 sows, 1-4 juveniles)
- **If one boar charges, others follow** (pack tactics, overwhelming targets)
- **Hunting priority:** Isolate single boar OR prepare for multiple opponents

---

## HUNTING PROCEDURES

### **Pre-Hunt Preparation**

**Party Composition (Recommended):**

**Option A - Adventurer Party (3-5 members):**
- **Tank/Fighter:** Engage boar head-on (absorb charge, pin down)
- **Ranged DPS:** Archers/crossbowmen (damage from distance, prevent charge closing)
- **Support:** Healer/utility (stabilize injured, crowd control if multiple boar)
- **Challenge:** CR 1 per boar (deadly for solo level 1, moderate for party of 3-4 level 2+)

**Option B - Experienced Hunters (2-3 + Dogs):**
- **Hunter with Spear:** Primary combatant (brace spear for charge, grapple)
- **Archer:** Ranged support (wound boar before close combat)
- **Hunting Dogs (2-4):** Tracking, flushing, harrying (bait charges, distract)
- **Advantage:** Dogs split boar attention (pack vs pack), hunters exploit openings

**Equipment Required:**
- **Spears:** Boar spear (crossguard prevents boar closing after impalement) - recommended
- **Heavy Crossbow or Longbow:** Ranged damage (1d10/1d8)
- **Leather Armor minimum:** AC 11+ (boar AC 11 = 50% hit rate, but charge damage serious)
- **Rope:** Securing downed boar, tying off carcass for transport
- **Hunting Horn:** Signal group, call for aid if injured
- **Healing Potions (1-2):** Boar charge can drop low-HP characters (2d6+1 = 2-13 damage)

**Skill Checks:**

**Tracking Boar (Survival):**
- **DC 10:** Find recent boar tracks (rooting, droppings, rubs on trees)
- **DC 12:** Track to sounder location (den, feeding area)
- **DC 15:** Predict ambush points, anticipate charge paths

**Approaching Undetected (Stealth):**
- **DC 12:** Approach within 60 feet without alerting (archers position)
- **DC 15:** Approach within 30 feet (melee ambush positioning)
- **Boar Passive Perception:** 9 (relatively easy to sneak on, but dense forest = noise)

---

### **Hunt Encounter**

**Encounter Distance:**
- **Ideal:** 60-80 feet (ranged attacks first, close to 30 feet for melee)
- **Ambush (Boar Surprise):** 20-40 feet (boar charge IMMEDIATELY, no ranged prep time)

**Round 1 (If party sees boar first):**
1. **Ranged attacks:** Archers shoot (soften target, ideally 7+ damage triggers Relentless early)
2. **Positioning:** Melee fighters brace for charge (ready action: spear when boar closes)
3. **Boar reaction:** Charge at nearest threat (typically loudest/closest character)

**Round 2 (Charge Impact):**
4. **Boar charges:** 30-40 feet movement + tusk attack + charge damage (2d6+1) + STR save
5. **Melee engages:** Ready actions trigger (spear attacks as boar closes)
6. **Critical moment:** If boar hits 0 HP from ready action, Relentless triggers (boar at 1 HP still attacks!)

**Round 3+ (Melee Combat):**
7. **Close quarters:** Boar can't charge again (already adjacent), standard tusk attacks (1d6+1)
8. **Party focus fire:** Multiple attacks to overcome Relentless
9. **Dog tactics (if present):** Dogs harass flanks (boar distracted, attacks split)

**Victory Condition:**
- Boar reaches 0 HP (after Relentless used) = dead
- **Capture (rare):** Net, rope grapple (Athletics contest - boar STR +1, dangerous)

---

### **Common Hunting Mistakes (Deadly Results)**

**Solo Hunting:**
- CR 1 = deadly for level 1 solo (boar charge can one-shot: 2d6+1 = 2-13, avg 8)
- Even level 2-3 solo = risky (Relentless means boar survives first kill blow)
- **Recommendation:** NEVER hunt boar solo below level 4

**Underestimating Sounders:**
- Find one boar, assume solo = **WRONG**
- Sounder (2-8 boar) nearby = **multiply CR by number**
- 4 boar sounder = CR 4 encounter (deadly for level 1-2 party)
- **Procedure:** Scout area, confirm lone boar OR prepare for pack fight

**Poor Positioning:**
- Fighting in dense forest = boar advantage (charge from 20 feet in brush = no warning)
- Open ground = hunter advantage (see charge coming, ready actions, ranged focus)
- **Recommendation:** Lure boar into clearing (bait, calls), avoid dense brush combat

**Ignoring Relentless:**
- Assume first kill blow drops boar = boar gets free attack at 1 HP (often lethal)
- **Tactic:** Overkill damage (ensure 8+ damage attacks) OR multi-hit focus (trigger Relentless early, finish with second wave)

---

### **Injury & Risk**

**Common Boar Hunting Injuries:**

**Tusk Goring:**
- Damage: 1d6+1 slashing (avg 4-5)
- **Charge goring:** 2d6+1 (avg 8) - can incapacitate low-HP characters
- **Bleeding wounds:** Tusk slashes deep (Medicine DC 10 to stabilize bleeding = 1 HP/round loss until treated)

**Knockdown (Prone):**
- Charge STR save fail = knocked prone
- **Danger:** Boar gets advantage on prone target next round (pack tactics if multiple boar)
- Standing from prone = half movement (vulnerable)

**Infection Risk:**
- Boar tusks dirty (forest debris, bacteria)
- Untreated wounds = infection (Constitution save DC 12 after 24 hours or diseased)
- **Prevention:** Clean wounds immediately (healer's kit, Lesser Restoration spell)

**Death Rate (Historical):**
Boar hunting casualty rate: **~5-10%** of hunts result in serious injury (level 1-3 hunters). Experienced hunters (level 4+, hunting dogs) reduce to <1%.

---

## FIELD DRESSING & TRANSPORT

### **Immediate Processing (Field Dressing)**

**Must be done within 1-2 hours of kill** (prevent spoilage, especially in warm weather).

**Procedure:**

1. **Bleed out:** Throat cut (carotid arteries) - if not already dead from combat wounds
2. **Position:** Hang by rear legs OR lay on back (belly up)
3. **Opening cut:** Sternum to pelvis (careful - avoid puncturing intestines)
4. **Remove organs:** Pull out viscera (intestines, stomach, liver, heart, lungs)
   - **Save:** Heart, liver (edible, valuable)
   - **Discard:** Intestines, stomach contents (non-edible, spoilage risk)
5. **Rinse cavity:** Water (if available) or wipe clean with cloth
6. **Cool:** Prop cavity open (stick/rope spread) - air circulation prevents bacterial growth

**Time Required:** 20-30 minutes (experienced), 45-60 minutes (novice)

**Survival Skill Check:**
- **DC 10:** Successful field dress (meat preserved, no contamination)
- **DC 8 or lower:** Partial success (some meat salvage, reduced quality)
- **Fail (≤5):** Puncture intestines (contamination, 30-50% meat loss)

**Weight Reduction:**
- Live boar: 300 lbs (example)
- Field dressed: ~210 lbs (30% weight loss - organs, blood, intestinal contents removed)
- **Transport:** Still heavy, requires 2-3 people OR travois/cart

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Processing Techniques, Field Dressing & Wild Game**

---

### **Transport to Butcher/Camp**

**Distance Considerations:**

**≤1 mile:** Carry (2-3 strong characters, STR 14+)
- **Encumbrance:** 210 lbs ÷ 3 people = 70 lbs each (heavy, manageable short distance)

**1-5 miles:** Travois (drag frame, 1-2 people pull)
- **Construction:** Cut two poles (8-10 feet), lash crossbars, secure boar
- **Time to build:** 30 minutes (Survival DC 10)
- **Travel speed:** Half normal walking speed (difficult terrain)

**5+ miles:** Cart/wagon (if available), OR quarter in field (break into primals, transport separately)
- **Quartering:** Removes legs, loin, ribs (transport in pieces, easier carry)
- **Disadvantage:** More field contamination risk, but necessary for long distance without cart

**Spoilage Timeline:**

**Cool Weather (40-60°F):**
- Field dressed: 24-36 hours until spoilage begins
- **Refrigeration/ice:** 3-5 days
- **Target:** Transport and process within 12-24 hours

**Warm Weather (70-85°F):**
- Field dressed: 8-12 hours until spoilage begins
- **Immediate processing essential** (bacterial growth rapid)
- **Target:** Transport and process within 6-8 hours

**Hot Weather (85°F+):**
- Field dressed: 4-6 hours (spoilage very rapid)
- **Emergency measures:** Smoke meat in field, heavy salt cure, immediate consumption
- **Recommendation:** Don't hunt boar in extreme heat (meat likely lost)

## PROCESSING & YIELDS

### **Processing Yields (300 lb wild boar - male)**

**Breakdown:**
```
Live Weight: 300 lbs (large boar)
↓ (65% dressing - wild game = lower than domestic due to fighting injury, dense bone/hide)
Dressed Weight: 195 lbs
↓ (4% loss during aging/trim - wild game = more trim waste)
Aged Weight: 187 lbs
↓ (52% retail - wild game = more bone, less fat, tougher cuts)
Retail Cuts: 97 lbs

Total Retail Yield: 32.3% live to retail (-6.5% under domestic baseline)
```

**Complete Breakdown:**
```
RETAIL CUTS: 97 lbs (32.3%)
- Premium (loin, tenderloin): 25 lbs (LEAN, gamey)
- Choice (shoulder, ham): 32 lbs (TOUGH, requires slow cooking)
- Standard (belly, ribs): 28 lbs (MINIMAL FAT, lean ribs)
- Utility (ground, trim): 12 lbs (MORE TRIM - tougher cuts ground)

BYPRODUCTS:
+ Lard: 15 lbs (5% live weight - VERY LEAN wild game) @ 2.5-3 sp/lb = 37.5-45 sp
+ HIDE (thick, valuable): 21 lbs (7%) @ 2.5-3 sp/lb = 52.5-63 sp ⭐
+ TUSKS (trophy): 2-4 lbs (pair) @ 15-30 sp (VALUABLE TROPHY) ⭐
+ SKULL (mount): 8 lbs @ 10-20 sp (TROPHY) ⭐
+ Organs: 9 lbs @ various = 4 sp
+ Bones: 18 lbs @ 0.2 sp/lb = 3.6 sp

USABLE PRODUCTS: 160 lbs (53.3%)
WASTE: 140 lbs (46.7%)
```

**Critical Differences from Domestic:**
- **Lower dressing %:** Wild game = fighting injuries, denser bone structure
- **More trim waste:** Tougher muscle, more connective tissue = ground meat
- **TROPHY VALUE:** Tusks, hide, skull add 80-120 sp value (often exceeds meat value!)
- **Lean meat:** 5% lard (vs 10% domestic) - wild boar don't fatten like domestic

### **Processing Time**

**Total Active Labor:** 14-16 hours average (+4-6 hours over domestic)

**Timeline:**
- Field dressing: 0.5-1 hour (already done during hunt)
- Initial processing: 2-3 hours (larger, tougher, wild = slower)
- Aging: 7-14 days (wild game benefits from aging - tenderizes tough muscle)
- Primal breakdown: 2-3 hours (dense bone, connective tissue)
- Retail fabrication: 6-8 hours (more grinding, tough cuts)
- **Trophy processing:** 2-3 hours (tusk extraction, skull cleaning, hide tanning prep)

**Labor Cost:** ~60 sp (15 hours × 4 sp/hour journeyman rate)

**Why Longer:**
- Wild game = unpredictable (combat damage, irregular cuts)
- Tough muscle = careful trimming (more connective tissue removal)
- Trophy processing = specialized skill (tusk removal without damage, skull cleaning)

## FOUNDRY ITEM BREAKDOWN

**From one 300 lb Western Wild Boar:**

### **PREMIUM CUTS (Loin - 25 lbs) - LEAN, GAMEY**

**LOIN (No butcher's choice - wild game = irregular, process as best possible):**
- 12 Bone-In Pork Chops (wild, 14 oz, LEAN) @ 2 sp each (gamey flavor, not premium pricing)
- 2 Pork Tenderloins (small, 0.9 lbs each) @ 3 sp each
- 1 Rack Baby Back Ribs (4.5 lbs, minimal meat) @ 2 sp/lb = 9 sp

**Note:** Wild boar loin is LEAN (minimal marbling), GAMEY (strong pork flavor), TOUGH (requires marinating or slow cooking). Not comparable to domestic premium cuts.

---

### **CHOICE CUTS (Shoulder, Ham - 32 lbs) - VERY TOUGH**

**SHOULDER:**
- 1 Boston Butt Roast (3.5 lbs, tough) @ 1.8 sp/lb = 6.3 sp
- 1 Picnic Roast (bone-in, 9 lbs, very tough) @ 1.5 sp/lb = 13.5 sp
- 2 Front Hocks @ 1 sp each

**HAM (almost always ground or slow-cooked - too tough for fresh steaks):**
- 2 Bone-In Ham Portions (irregular, 8 lbs each) @ 1.8 sp/lb = 14.4 sp each
- 2 Rear Hocks @ 1 sp each

**Meat Characteristics:**
- Dense muscle (wild boar = active, fighting)
- Heavy connective tissue (requires 6-8 hour braise or grinding)
- Gamey flavor (acorn/forest diet + adrenaline from wild life)

---

### **STANDARD CUTS (Belly, Ribs - 28 lbs) - MINIMAL FAT**

**BELLY (Poor fresh/bacon potential - too lean, gamey):**
- 1 Whole Pork Belly (18 lbs, thin fat layer) @ 1.5 sp/lb = 27 sp

**Belly Characteristics:**
- Minimal fat (15% fat / 85% meat vs 50/50 domestic)
- Gamey flavor (not suitable for traditional bacon)
- **Best use:** Ground into sausage (fat content helps bind)

**RIBS:**
- 1 Rack Spareribs (4 lbs, minimal meat) @ 2 sp/lb = 8 sp
- **Best preparation:** Long smoke (BBQ style, 6-8 hours low temp)

---

### **UTILITY CUTS (Ground, Trim - 12 lbs) - PRIMARY USE FOR TOUGH CUTS**

- 10 Ground Wild Boar packages (1 lb) @ 1.8 sp each (lean ground, gamey)
- 2 Wild Boar Stew Meat packages (1 lb) @ 1.5 sp each

**Note:** Wild boar ground meat is **lean** (must add fat for binding - pork fat or beef fat). Gamey flavor = excellent for sausage, chili, bold-flavored dishes.

---

### **TROPHIES & BYPRODUCTS (HIGH VALUE)**

**TUSKS (Primary Trophy - VALUABLE) ⭐:**
- 1 Pair Tusks (matched set, 6-10 inches length)
- **Quality grades:**

  - **Good:** 20-25 sp (medium boar, 8-9 inches, clean)
  - **Exceptional:** 25-35 sp (large boar, 10+ inches, pristine, impressive curve)
- **Use:** Jewelry (pendants, earrings), dagger hilts, decorative mounts, status symbols

**HIDE (Thick, Durable - VALUABLE) ⭐:**
- 1 Hide (21 lbs, thick bristles, battle scars)
- **Value:** 2.5-3 sp/lb = 52.5-63 sp
- **Quality:** Thicker than domestic (wild = dense coat, protection from combat)
- **Use:** Leather armor (AC +1 bonus if wild boar hide), boots, belts, rugged gear

**SKULL (Mounted Trophy):**
- 1 Boar Skull (cleaned, 8 lbs)
- **Value:** 10-20 sp (depends on tusk size, skull size, preparation quality)
- **Use:** Wall mount (tavern, hunter's lodge, personal trophy), intimidation display

**LARD (Minimal, Gamey):**
- 6 lbs Leaf Lard @ 3 sp/lb = 18 sp
- 9 lbs Standard Lard @ 2.5 sp/lb = 22.5 sp
- **Total:** 40.5 sp
- **Note:** Wild boar lard has **gamey undertones** (not suitable for baking - use for savory cooking only)

**ORGANS:**
- 1 Heart (1 lb) @ 1.5 sp
- 1 Liver (3 lbs) @ 2 sp whole (gamey, strong flavor - acquired taste)
- 2 Kidneys @ 0.6 sp

**BONES:**
- 6 Soup Bone packages (3 lbs each) @ 0.2 sp each = 1.2 sp

---

### **TOTAL VALUE (Meat + Trophies):**

```

**Processing cost:** 60 sp (15 hours labor)
**Net value:** 234 sp

**Hunting Investment:**
- Time: 4-12 hours (tracking, hunting, transport)
- Risk: Injury potential (healing, recovery time)
- Supplies: Arrows/bolts (2-5 sp), equipment wear
- **Net profit:** 150-200 sp (after costs, risk consideration)

---

## CULINARY CHARACTERISTICS

### **Wild Boar vs Domestic Pork - Flavor Profile**

**Wild Boar:**
- **Gamey:** Strong pork flavor (more intense than domestic)
- **Lean:** Minimal fat = requires added fat in cooking OR slow, moist methods
- **Tough:** Dense muscle, connective tissue = braise, stew, grind
- **Forest notes:** Acorn, mast diet = nutty undertones (similar to Trielta/Cormyrean, but wilder)
- **Adrenaline:** Wild life + combat stress = potential stronger flavor (varies by hunt stress level)

**Domestic Pork (Comparison):**
- **Mild:** Gentle pork flavor
- **Marbled:** Fat throughout = moist, tender
- **Tender:** Can grill, roast, pan-fry easily
- **Grain/controlled diet:** Consistent, predictable flavor

### **Best Cooking Methods for Wild Boar**

**Slow Cooking / Braising (Optimal):**
- **Cuts:** Shoulder, ham, tough roasts
- **Method:** 6-8 hours low temp (250-275°F), liquid (wine, stock, beer)
- **Result:** Connective tissue breaks down, meat tender, gamey flavor mellowed

**Grinding / Sausage (Excellent):**
- **Cuts:** Trim, shoulder, belly
- **Method:** Grind with added pork/beef fat (30% fat ratio - wild boar too lean), bold spices
- **Result:** Gamey flavor = ASSET in sausage (distinctive, desirable for wild game sausage)

**Smoking (Very Good):**
- **Cuts:** Ribs, ham, shoulder
- **Method:** Long smoke (6-8 hours), low temp, heavy wood smoke (hickory, mesquite)
- **Result:** Smoke complements gamey flavor, tenderizes, preserves

**Marinating (Necessary for Grilling):**
- **Cuts:** Loin chops, tenderloin (if grilling/pan-searing)
- **Method:** Acid marinade (wine, vinegar, citrus) + bold spices, 12-24 hours
- **Result:** Tenderizes, mellows gamey flavor, adds moisture

**Grilling (Challenging, Not Recommended):**
- Wild boar too lean = dries out, tough
- **Only if:** Heavily marinated, cooked to medium-rare (130-135°F max), rested
- **Better:** Use slow cooking methods instead

---

## PRESERVATION METHODS

### **Smoked Wild Boar (Traditional)**

**Best Application:** Shoulder, ham

**Process:**
1. Brine cure (salt, sugar, Prague Powder, spices) - 5-7 days
2. Rinse, dry - 12 hours
3. Heavy smoke (hickory, mesquite) - 8-12 hours at 180-220°F
4. Cool, package

**Yields:**
- 32 lbs shoulder/ham → 26 lbs smoked wild boar

**Value:**
- Fresh: 32 lbs @ 1.8 sp/lb avg = 57.6 sp
- **Smoked:** 26 lbs @ 3.5-4 sp/lb = 91-104 sp
- **VALUE INCREASE: +58-81%** (33.4-46.4 sp profit)

**Flavor:** Smoke + gamey = excellent pairing (traditional hunter preservation)

---

### **Wild Boar Sausage (Optimal Use for Trim)**

**Trim + Belly Ground → Bold Sausage**

**Formula (20 lbs wild boar + 10 lbs added pork fat):**
- Wild boar meat: 20 lbs (lean)
- Pork fat (domestic pig back fat): 10 lbs (30% fat ratio total)
- Spices: Heavy (sage, fennel, black pepper, garlic - bold to match gamey flavor)

**Yields:** 28 lbs fresh wild boar sausage

**Value:**
- Wild boar meat cost: 20 lbs @ 1.8 sp/lb = 36 sp
- Added fat cost: 10 lbs @ 1.5 sp/lb = 15 sp
- Spice cost: 5 sp
- **Total input:** 56 sp

**Output:**
- 28 lbs fresh wild boar sausage @ 3-4 sp/lb = 84-112 sp
- **NET PROFIT:** 28-56 sp (+50-100% value increase)

**Market:** Specialty sausage (hunters, adventurers, taverns). "Wild Boar Sausage" commands premium over standard pork sausage.

---

## ECONOMICS SUMMARY

**From One 300 lb Wild Boar Hunt:**

### **COSTS:**
```
Hunting supplies: 5-10 sp (arrows, repairs)
Transport/time: 10-15 sp equivalent (labor hours)
Processing labor: 60 sp
Risk factor: Variable (injury potential)
---
Total costs: 75-85 sp + risk
```

### **REVENUE:**
```
Meat (retail): 151 sp
Trophies (tusks, hide, skull): 98 sp
Byproducts (lard, organs, bones): 46 sp
---
Total revenue: 295 sp

Net profit: 210-220 sp
```

### **ALTERNATIVE: SMOKED MEAT + TROPHIES:**
```
Smoked wild boar: 98 sp (vs 58 sp fresh shoulder/ham)
Fresh loin/ribs: 53 sp
Trophies: 98 sp
Byproducts: 46 sp
---
Total revenue: 295 sp (similar, but preserved shelf life)

Net profit: 210-220 sp + extended storage value
```

### **IS BOAR HUNTING PROFITABLE?**

**YES, if:**
- Party succeeds without serious injury (healing costs can erase profit)
- Successful field dressing (Survival check passes, no meat loss)
- Trophy quality good (large tusks, intact hide = 80-100 sp vs 50-70 sp poor quality)
- Market access for wild game (taverns, specialty butchers)

**MARGINAL, if:**
- Multiple party injuries (healing potions, temple fees = 50-100 sp+ costs)
- Failed field dressing (30-50% meat loss = 45-75 sp lost revenue)
- Poor trophy quality (broken tusks, damaged hide = -30-50 sp)
- No wild game market (must sell at standard pork prices = -30-50 sp)

**NO, if:**
- Party deaths (resurrection costs = thousands of sp, total economic failure)
- Complete meat spoilage (field dressing fail + heat + transport delay = total loss)

**Recommendation:** Boar hunting is **profitable for competent parties** (level 2+, experienced hunters). Not recommended for level 1 parties (high risk, low margin for error).

---

## CULTURAL NOTES

### **Boar Hunting as Tradition**

**Western Heartlands:**
- Fall boar hunt = seasonal tradition (men's groups, village cooperation)
- Trophy boars = status symbol (large tusks displayed in homes, taverns)
- Fresh meat feast = celebratory meal (community shares kill)
- Smoked boar = winter provisions (preserved meat + domestic pork)

**Nobility:**
- Estate hunts = entertainment (nobles + guests, elaborate ceremony)
- Trophy competition (who kills largest boar? Biggest tusks?)
- Feast centerpiece (whole roasted boar = wealth/success display)
- Hounds/beaters = staff support (professional hunt organization)

**Adventurers:**
- Boar hunt = CR 1 encounter for profit (meat + trophies = dungeon alternative)
- Wilderness survival (hunting provides food during travel)
- Skill development (tracking, combat tactics, field dressing = practical training)

### **Trophy Culture**

**Tusk Value Hierarchy:**

**Common (15-20 sp):**
- Small boar (6-7 inch tusks)
- Minor chips/damage
- Standard market

**Quality (20-25 sp):**

**Legendary (40-60 sp+):**
- Massive boar (12+ inch tusks - rare)
- Perfect symmetry, dramatic curve
- Named trophies ("The Beast of Trielta," "Ironjaw")
- Story value (difficult hunt, near-death experience)

**Trophy Uses:**
- Tavern decoration (hunter's lodge aesthetic)
- Personal pride (mantle display, hunting room)
- Jewelry (pendants, earrings - status symbol)
- Weapon decoration (dagger hilts, spear inlay)
- Guild certification (proof of hunting prowess)

### **Boar in Folklore**

**Symbolism:**
- **Courage:** Boar fights back (not prey, but worthy opponent)
- **Ferocity:** Relentless attack, dangerous even wounded
- **Masculinity:** Boar hunting = test of manhood (traditional cultures)
- **Wildness:** Forest spirit, untamed nature

**Sayings:**
- *"Tough as boar hide"* (resilient, durable)
- *"Charges like a boar"* (reckless aggression)
- *"Boar's courage"* (fights despite being outmatched)

---

## PROFESSIONAL NOTES

**For Butchers:**

**When to Buy Wild Boar (Hunters Sell to You):**
- **Trophy quality:** Intact tusks, good hide (resale value)
- **Fresh condition:** Field dressed within hours, proper cooling (meat salvageable)
- **Fall season:** Fattened on mast (better meat quality than spring-hunted lean boar)
- **Specialty market:** Taverns, adventurers want "wild game" menu items

**Pricing for Wild Boar (Wholesale from Hunters):**
- **Carcass (whole, field dressed):** 1-1.5 sp/lb live weight equivalent (300 lb boar = 300-450 sp)
- **Trophies separate:** Buy tusks (15-30 sp), hide (25-40 sp), skull (10-20 sp) separately
- **Total purchase:** 350-540 sp for good quality wild boar + trophies

**Processing Strategy:**
1. **Extract trophies first** (tusks, skull - sell to trophy dealers, craftsmen)
2. **Assess meat quality** (older boar = grind most, young boar = some roasts)
3. **Smoke or cure** (wild game spoils faster - preserve immediately)
4. **Market as specialty** (charge 150-200% of domestic pork - "wild game" premium)

**For Adventurers/Hunters:**

**Is Boar Hunting Worth It? (Level-by-Level)**

**Level 1:**
- **NO** (CR 1 = deadly, high injury risk)
- Boar charge (2d6+1) can one-shot (max 13 damage vs 6-10 HP wizard)
- Relentless = requires focused fire (difficult with low attack bonuses)
- **Recommendation:** Avoid until level 2

**Level 2-3:**
- **YES, with preparation** (CR 1 = moderate challenge)
- Party of 3-4 = manageable (focus fire, tactical positioning)
- Profit: 200+ sp per boar ÷ party = 50-75 sp per member
- **Recommendation:** Hunt in groups, scout for lone boar (avoid sounders)

**Level 4+:**
- **YES, profitable** (CR 1 = easy)
- Can solo or duo (reduced risk)
- Profit: Full 200+ sp (solo) or split fewer ways
- **Recommendation:** Efficient wilderness income (better than CR 1 goblin camp raids - boar don't have allies to avenge them)

**— Thadius Del Irontet**
*"I've dressed 30+ wild boar in my career. Every single one arrived with arrow wounds, tusk gouges on hunting dog corpses nearby, and a hunter with a limp explaining how the boar 'almost got him.' Wild boar aren't food - they're opponents who happen to be delicious if you win. Respect the beast, or it'll be your last hunt."*

**— Garrett Ironwood, Veteran Hunter (Trielta Hills)**
*"Killed my first boar at 16 with my father's spear. Boar charged, I braced, spear went through its chest. Boar kept coming. Knocked me flat, broke two ribs, gored my thigh. My father killed it with a second spear. I got 30 silver for the meat and tusks. My broken ribs cost 40 silver to heal. Next hunt, I brought six friends and hunting dogs. Made 180 silver, split seven ways, no injuries. That's the lesson: boar hunting ain't solo work."*
