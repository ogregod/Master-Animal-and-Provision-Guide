# TRIELTA FOREST PIG
## Acorn-Finished Country Ham Excellence

*In the Trielta Hills, small farmers let pigs roam oak forests every fall, fattening on acorns for 2-3 months before slaughter. The result: nutty, sweet pork that ages into exceptional country hams. Not as prestigious as Cormyrean Black, but honest farmers producing honest quality. A 9-month Trielta ham costs half what Cormyrean charges, tastes 80% as good, and feeds a family for weeks. That's country wisdom.*

**Market Position:** Regional Premium - "Trielta Forest Ham" local pride

**Slaughter Age:** 10-12 months at optimal weight (extended acorn finishing)

---

## PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### **Size & Weight**

**Processing Standard:** 220 lb pig at 10-12 months

**Live Weight by Development:**
- **Standard Pasture** (7-8 months): 180-200 lbs (not optimal - lacks acorn finish)
- **Acorn Pannage Finish** (10-12 months): 210-230 lbs (PEAK QUALITY)
- **Extended Finish** (13-14 months): 240-260 lbs (diminishing returns, small farms can't afford)

**Growth Rate:** ~0.75 lbs/day overall (slower than grain-fed due to forest foraging, but acorn finishing intensive last 2-3 months)

**Key Difference from Baseline:** -30 lbs lighter (forest-raised, not grain-fed), but **premium flavor** from acorn diet.

**Acorn Finishing Period:**
Sept-Nov (oak mast season). Pigs released into forest (supervised), forage on acorns, chestnuts, beechnuts. This creates distinctive **nutty, sweet flavor** in fat and meat.

### **Appearance**

**Color:**
- Red/brown with white patches (50% - traditional forest breed)
- Black with white markings (30%)
- Solid red (15%)
- White/pink (5%)

**Build:**
- **Medium frame, lean body** (forest foraging = active lifestyle)
- **Well-developed legs** (forest roaming, rooting behavior)
- **Long snout** (forest foraging adaptation)
- **Moderate fat cover** (less than Cormyrean Black, but well-finished on acorns)

**Distinctive Features:**
- Lean, muscular build (active foraging)
- Strong legs and shoulders (forest terrain adaptation)
- Alert demeanor (semi-wild forest behavior)
- Coat often has mud/forest debris (outdoor living)

**Height:** 28-32 inches at shoulder

### **Temperament**

**Disposition:** Independent, moderate to active

- Forest-raised (semi-wild instincts, foraging behavior)
- Less socialized than grain-fed (outdoor living, limited human contact)
- Food-motivated during mast season (acorn foraging drives behavior)
- Wary but manageable (experienced farmers know handling techniques)

**Processing Note:** More active than docile breeds (stress management important for ham quality). Forest pigs require calm, patient handling.

## COUNTRY HAM PRODUCTION (PRIMARY PURPOSE)

### **TRIELTA FOREST HAM - Acorn-Finished Aged Ham**

**Why Trielta Forest Pig Excels at Country Ham:**

1. **Acorn Flavor:** Nutty, sweet base (distinctive, regional identity)
2. **Fat Quality:** Acorn fats resist rancidity (aging stability for 9-12 months)
3. **Muscle Development:** Forest roaming = well-developed leg muscles
4. **Size:** 15 lbs per ham (smaller than Cormyrean, but family-sized portions)
5. **Tradition:** 100+ years Trielta farmer expertise (local knowledge, technique)
6. **Price Point:** Accessible premium (middle-market, not ultra-luxury)

**Country Ham Process (Trielta Method - 6-9 months):**

**Dry Salt Cure (20-30 days):**

**Formula (per 100 lbs ham):**
- 8 lbs coarse salt
- 1.5 lbs dark brown sugar
- 3 oz Prague Powder #2
- 1 oz black pepper (coarse)
- 0.5 oz local herbs (optional - wild sage, thyme foraged in Trielta)

**Process:**
1. **Heavy salt rub** (1 lb salt per 15 lbs ham)
2. **Pack in salt bed** (40-45°F, dry location - farm cellar or smokehouse)
3. **Reapply weekly** (fresh salt, remove moisture)
4. **Total cure:** 20-30 days (1.3-2 days per pound)

**Equalization (10-14 days):**
5. **Rinse thoroughly** (remove all surface salt)
6. **Soak** (8-16 hours cold water - remove excess surface salt)
7. **Dry** (hang 10-14 days, air-dry, pellicle formation)

**Aging (6-9 months optimal):**
8. **Hang in controlled environment:**
   - Temperature: 50-65°F (farm cellar, smokehouse rafters)
   - Humidity: 60-75% (country conditions, less precise than estate aging)
   - Airflow: Natural ventilation (windows, drafts - not controlled like Cormyrean)

9. **Monthly maintenance:**
   - Inspect for mold (white = good, black = scrape/trim)
   - Check for spoilage (smell test, visual inspection)
   - Rotate position (even air exposure)
   - Document weight loss (target: 28-32% over 9 months)

10. **Evaluation:**
    - **6 months:** Good quality (28-30% weight loss, developed flavor)
    - **9 months:** Excellent quality (30-32% weight loss, complex, nutty)
    - **12 months:** Premium quality (33-35% weight loss, intense - rare for Trielta)

**Yields:**

**6-Month Cure:**
- 30 lbs fresh ham (both hams) → 21 lbs aged (30% weight loss)
- 2 hams (10.5 lbs each)

**9-Month Cure:**
- 30 lbs fresh ham → 20 lbs aged (33% weight loss)
- 2 hams (10 lbs each)

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods, Ham Curing, Country Long-Cure Aging**

---

### **HAM VALUE COMPARISON**

**Fresh Ham vs Country Aged (Trielta Forest):**

```
FRESH HAM (both hams):
30 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb = 75 sp

6-MONTH AGED HAM:
21 lbs @ 8 sp/lb = 168 sp ⭐
Value increase: +124% (93 sp profit)
Time: 6-7 months total

9-MONTH AGED HAM:
20 lbs @ 10 sp/lb = 200 sp ⭐⭐
Value increase: +167% (125 sp profit)
Time: 9-10 months total

12-MONTH AGED HAM (rare, exceptional):
18 lbs @ 12 sp/lb = 216 sp ⭐⭐⭐
Value increase: +188% (141 sp profit)
Time: 12-13 months total
```

**Pricing Explanation:**

**Why Trielta 9-month ham costs 10 sp/lb (vs 15 sp/lb Cormyrean 12-month):**

**Lower Price:**
1. **Smaller hams:** 10 lbs vs 14 lbs (less impressive presentation)
2. **Rustic aging:** Farm cellars vs controlled estate chambers (less precision)
3. **Brand prestige:** Regional pride vs nobility luxury (market positioning)
4. **Accessibility:** Middle-market vs ultra-luxury (more buyers at lower price)

**Same/Better Flavor:**
1. **Acorn finish:** Comparable to Cormyrean (both acorn-fed)
2. **Aging technique:** Similar process (traditional country method)
3. **Quality:** Excellent (90-95% of Cormyrean quality at 67% of price)

**Market Position:**
Trielta Forest Ham is **"working family's aged ham"** - accessible premium (butcher, wealthy artisan, merchant) vs Cormyrean (nobility only).

**Where Sold:**
- Daggerford markets (local pride, regional specialty)
- Waterdeep Trades Ward (middle-market butchers)
- Specialty shops (not Sea Ward luxury - North/Castle Ward quality shops)
- Direct farm sales (Trielta farmers to Waterdeep restaurants/taverns)

**Customer Profile:**
- Successful artisans (bakers, smiths - special occasions)
- Wealthy merchants (regular purchase, not daily)
- Middle-tier taverns (premium menu item, markup to 1.5-2 gp/serving)
- Butchers (stock for quality-conscious customers)

---

## BACON PRODUCTION (Secondary Product)

Trielta Forest also produces **very good bacon** (acorn-fed advantage).

### **Acorn-Fed Bacon**

**Process:** Standard bacon cure (see Daggerford Farm Pig)

**Yields:**
- 17 lbs fresh belly → 13 lbs cured bacon

**Value:**
- Fresh belly: 17 lbs @ 2.2 sp/lb = 37.4 sp
- **Acorn-fed bacon:** 13 lbs @ 5-6 sp/lb = 65-78 sp ⭐
- **VALUE INCREASE: +74-109%** (27.6-40.6 sp profit)

**Acorn Bacon Premium:**
- Nutty undertones (distinctive, complex)
- Firm texture (acorn fat quality)
- Regional brand ("Trielta Forest Bacon" - recognized quality)

**Market:** Quality butchers (4-5 sp/lb wholesale, 6-7 sp/lb retail). Not as prestigious as Goldenfields (6 sp/lb wholesale), but **better than standard (4 sp/lb)**.

**Farm Strategy:**
Most farmers cure bacon (quicker return than ham - 2 weeks vs 9 months). Some do both (bacon for immediate revenue, ham for aged premium).

---

## SAUSAGE & LARD (Standard Products)

**Boston Butt Sausage:**
- 12 lbs Boston Butt → 10 lbs sausage
- Fresh sausage: 10 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb = 25 sp
- (vs fresh Boston Butt: 12 lbs @ 2.8 sp/lb = 33.6 sp)
- **Not recommended** - sell fresh roasts (higher value)

**Lard:**
- Already included in byproducts (100 sp)
- Acorn lard sold to specialty bakers (regional markets, Daggerford/Trielta Hills)
- Premium over standard lard (+0.5-1 sp/lb for acorn flavor)

- Only buy for fresh if acorn flavor justifies premium (specialty restaurants)

**ONLY buy Trielta Forest Pig if:**
1. Aging facilities (6-9 months capacity)
2. Middle-market access (butchers, quality taverns, wealthy artisans)
3. Regional market (Daggerford, Waterdeep Trades/North Ward)

Otherwise, buy Daggerford Farm (fresh, better economics) or Goldenfields (bacon, faster return).

---

## CULTURAL NOTES

### **Trielta Forest Pannage Tradition**

**Fall Acorn Season (Sept-Nov):**

Trielta Hills farmers release pigs into oak/chestnut forests (ancient tradition):

**Process:**
1. **Forest allocation:** Village commons OR estate permission (forest access negotiated)
2. **Supervised foraging:** Farmers rotate watching pigs (prevent loss, predation)
3. **Mast feeding:** Pigs root for acorns, chestnuts, beechnuts (natural diet)
4. **Weight monitoring:** Check pigs weekly (optimal finish = 210-230 lbs)
5. **Final slaughter:** Late Oct/Early Nov (post-mast season, pre-winter)

**Community Cooperation:**
- Shared forest access (village commons, cooperative use)
- Rotation schedules (prevent overgrazing, forest damage)
- Predator defense (group watching, dogs)
- Knowledge sharing (optimal pannage timing, forest conditions)

**Economic Reality:**
Forest access = premium product. Farmers without forest must buy feed = can't achieve acorn finish = standard pork pricing only.

### **Regional Pride & Competition**

**"Trielta Forest Ham" Brand:**

**Local Identity:**
- Trielta Hills farmers PROUD of ham quality
- Defensive against Cormyrean comparisons: *"Cormyrean costs triple, tastes 10% better. Trielta is working family's choice."*
- Regional festivals (Harvest Ham Tasting - farmers compete for best 9-month ham)

**Quality Competition:**
- Best farms earn reputation (specific farmers known for exceptional hams)
- Premium pricing (top Trielta farmer hams command 11-12 sp/lb vs 10 sp/lb average)
- Multi-generational skill (families pass down aging techniques, secret rubs)

**Cultural Saying:**
*"Cormyr for the nobles, Trielta for the people."* - Daggerford market wisdom

### **Market Position (Accessibility)**

**Middle-Market Sweet Spot:**

Trielta Forest Ham occupies critical market gap:

**Below Trielta (Accessibility):**
- Standard pork: 2-3 sp/lb (common, everyday)
- Short-cure ham: 5-6 sp/lb (preserved, but not aged)
- Goldenfields bacon: 6 sp/lb (premium preserved)

**Trielta Zone:**
- **6-month ham: 8 sp/lb** (entry aged ham)
- **9-month ham: 10 sp/lb** (excellent aged ham)

**Above Trielta (Luxury):**
- Cormyrean 12-month: 15 sp/lb (ultra-premium)
- Cormyrean 18-month: 20-25 sp/lb (nobility exclusive)

**Result:** Trielta Forest Ham is **affordable luxury** - special occasion for artisans, regular for wealthy merchants, aspirational for common folk.

### **Social Class & Use**

**Successful Artisans (Primary Market):**
- Special occasion purchase (weddings, major holidays)
- Half-ham purchase (5 lbs = 50 sp = substantial but achievable)
- Status display (serving Trielta ham = "I've succeeded")

**Wealthy Merchants:**
- Regular purchase (quarterly, not weekly)
- Full ham (10 lbs = 100 sp)
- Business gifts (aged ham as quality gift - respected, not ostentatious)

**Tavern Owners (Middle-Tier):**
- Menu premium item (Trielta ham plate = 1.5-2 gp)
- Markup: 100 sp ham → 150-200 portions (0.75-1 gp/portion) = 1.5-2 gp revenue per lb
- Quality reputation (having Trielta ham = quality establishment)

**Nobility (Rare):**
- Occasional purchase (variety from Cormyrean)
- Country estate entertaining (rustic authenticity - "honest farm ham")
- Not primary choice (Cormyrean prestige preferred)

**Common Folk:**
- Never whole ham (unaffordable - 100 sp = 20 days wages)
- Single-slice purchase (butcher sells 2-4 oz slices @ 5-8 sp for tasting)
- Festival sample (Harvest Fair tastings - community tradition)

## BREEDING NOTES (For Forest Farmers)

**Trielta Forest Selection Criteria:**

**Forest Foraging Ability (Primary):**
- Successful acorn finding (observational - which pigs gain weight during pannage)
- Root strength (rooting behavior = finding buried mast)
- Independence (comfortable in forest without constant supervision)

**Ham Development (Secondary):**
- Leg muscle development (forest roaming builds ham)
- Moderate fat cover (acorn finishing, not excessive)
- Ham shape (long, tapered - ideal for aging)

**Temperament (Tertiary):**
- Semi-wild acceptable (forest-raised, outdoor instincts)
- Calm during handling (processing stress management)
- Herd compatibility (group foraging, minimal aggression)

**Breeding Program:**
Small farmers maintain **local gene pool** (village breeding cooperative). Occasional outcross (Daggerford Farm genetics) for size/vigor, but acorn-finish ability prioritized.

**Breeding Stock Sales:**
Farmers occasionally sell gilts (young females) to new forest farmers:
- Price: 8-12 sp/lb (1,760-2,640 sp for 220 lb gilt)
- Requirements: Forest access (can't raise Trielta without pannage)
- Purpose: Establish forest herd, proven genetics

## PROFESSIONAL NOTES

**For Butchers:**

**When to Buy Trielta Forest:**
- Middle-market customer base (artisans, wealthy merchants)
- Aging facilities (6-9 months capacity)
- Regional market (Daggerford, Waterdeep Trades/North Ward)
- Country ham demand (customers seek aged ham, can't afford Cormyrean)

**When NOT to Buy:**
- Low-income customer base (can't afford 8-10 sp/lb ham)
- No aging facilities (wastes ham potential)
- Fresh pork focus (terrible economics - buy Daggerford instead)
- Ultra-luxury market (customers demand Cormyrean prestige)

**Processing Recommendation:**
ALWAYS age the hams (minimum 6 months). Selling Trielta fresh ham wastes 93-125 sp profit and destroys breed purpose.

**Marketing:**
- "Trielta Forest Ham - Acorn-Finished Excellence"
- "Country Tradition - 9-Month Aged"
- "Middle-Market Premium - Quality Without Nobility Pricing"

**Customer Education:**
Trielta Forest Ham requires customer education:
- "90% of Cormyrean quality, 67% of price" (value proposition)
- "Acorn-finished, 9-month aged" (quality indicators)
- Tasting samples (1-2 oz slices - flavor proof)

**— Thadius Del Irontet**
*"I've aged 50+ Trielta hams in 132 years. Not one matched the best Cormyrean. But 40 of them came damn close, cost half as much, and fed families for weeks instead of single noble feasts. That's not lesser quality - that's accessible excellence. Trielta Forest Pig is democracy in ham form."*

**— Jorren Hillstead, Trielta Forest Farmer**
*"My grandfather taught me: 'Let the pigs into the oak forest when acorns fall heavy. Wait until they're fat and happy. Cure the hams like your life depends on it. Age nine months minimum.' I've followed that wisdom for 40 years. My 9-month hams sell for 100 sp in Daggerford. That's my farm's entire profit for the year - from two pigs. The forest provides, if you know how to listen."*
