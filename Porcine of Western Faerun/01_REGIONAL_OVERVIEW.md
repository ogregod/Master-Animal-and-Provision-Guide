# REGIONAL OVERVIEW
## Swine Production Across Western Faerûn

*Pig farming patterns differ from cattle - smaller operations, more culturally complex, and deeply tied to seasonal preservation cycles. Understanding regional variations explains breed distribution, pricing, and cultural significance.*

## WESTERN FAERÛN PIG REGIONS

### **WESTERN HEARTLANDS** (Primary Production)

**Regions:** Daggerford, Secomber, Loudwater, Trielta Hills

**Climate:** Temperate, four distinct seasons

**Primary Breeds:**
- **Daggerford Farm Pig** (most common, 60% of regional production)
- **Trielta Forest Pig** (forest pannage, 15%)
- **Goldenfields Heritage** (grain-surplus areas, 10%)

**Production Scale:** Small family farms (5-20 pigs) + village cooperatives (30-50 pigs)

**Seasonal Cycle:**
- **Spring:** Farrowing (piglet births), March-May
- **Summer:** Pasture/forest foraging, rapid growth
- **Fall:** Final fattening (grain, acorns, mast), SLAUGHTER SEASON (Sept-Nov)
- **Winter:** Preservation, curing, aging products

**Cultural Significance:**
- Fall slaughter festivals (community labor exchange)
- Bacon/ham curing as household tradition
- Winter survival dependence (preserved pork + lard)
- Smokehouse architecture (every farm)

**Market Hubs:**
- Daggerford (farm direct, best prices)
- Secomber (river trade hub)
- Loudwater (northern distribution)

**Economics:**
- Fresh pork: 2.5-3.2 sp/lb (fall baseline)
- Preserved products: 4-7 sp/lb (winter premium)
- Lard: 4-5 sp/lb year-round

### **SWORD COAST CITIES** (Urban Commercial)

**Cities:** Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter

**Climate:** Coastal temperate to cold northern

**Primary Breeds:**
- **Waterdeep Common Hog** (urban waste-fed, 50% of city supply)
- **Neverwinter Northern Pig** (Neverwinter region, cold-adapted, 30%)
- **Imported Heartlands pigs** (Daggerford, Goldenfields, 20%)

**Production Scale:**
- Urban: Large commercial operations (100-300 pigs, waste-fed)
- Peri-urban: Small farms supplying city markets (20-80 pigs)
- Rural imports: Caravans from Heartlands (seasonal)

**Cultural Significance:**
- Guild regulations (Butchers' Guild controls processing)
- Street food culture (sausages, fried pork)
- Wealth disparity (fresh premium cuts vs preserved common cuts)
- Immigrant traditions (different sausage styles by neighborhood)

**Waterdeep Specifics:**
- Dock Ward: Common hog processing (waste-fed, lower quality)
- Sea Ward: Imported premium pork (Goldenfields, Cormyrean)
- Trades Ward: Sausage-makers (20+ shops, ethnic specialties)
- Castle Ward: Luxury ham aging (nobility, 6-12 month cures)

**Market Hubs:**
- Southern Ward Market (Waterdeep) - largest volume
- Neverwinter Docks - northern trade
- Baldur's Gate Low Lantern District - import hub

**Economics:**
- Fresh pork: 3-4 sp/lb (urban premium)
- Preserved products: 5-8 sp/lb (value-added, storage costs)
- Lard: 5-6 sp/lb (urban demand, soap/candles)
- Premium imports: 10-18 sp/lb (Cormyrean Black, Goldenfields Heritage)

---

### **THE NORTH** (Cold Climate Specialists)

**Regions:** Neverwinter environs, Luskan hinterlands, Icewind Dale (minimal)

**Climate:** Cold continental, long harsh winters

**Primary Breeds:**
- **Neverwinter Northern Pig** (90% of regional production, cold-adapted)
- **Imported Heartlands pigs** (summer only, 10%)

**Production Scale:** Small operations (3-12 pigs), essential winter survival

**Seasonal Cycle:**
- **Spring:** Late farrowing (April-June, cold delays)
- **Summer:** Intensive feeding (short growing season)
- **Fall:** CRITICAL slaughter window (August-October, before deep freeze)
- **Winter:** Frozen storage + preserved products sustain community

**Cultural Significance:**
- **Lard economy** - more valuable than meat (heating, light, cooking)
- Winter survival necessity (no refrigeration = preservation mandatory)
- Community smokehouses (shared infrastructure)
- Lard rendering festivals (social + economic event)

**Special Adaptations:**
- Thick fat layers (cold insulation)
- Shorter growing season (8-9 months vs 7-8 months standard)
- Natural freezing (outdoor storage Nov-March)
- Heavy preservation (70% of pork cured/smoked vs 40-50% elsewhere)

**Market Hubs:**
- Neverwinter (regional center)
- Luskan (limited, pirate disruption)
- Ten-Towns (Icewind Dale, rare, extremely expensive)

**Economics:**
- Fresh pork: 3.5-4.5 sp/lb (limited availability)
- Preserved products: 5-7 sp/lb (standard, necessary)
- **Lard: 5-7 sp/lb** (HIGHEST regional value, winter essential)

**Icewind Dale Note:**
Pig farming nearly impossible (extreme cold, short season). Imported preserved pork commands 100-200% premiums. Neverwinter Northern Pig only breed that CAN survive if heavily managed.

### **CORMYR** (Luxury Estate Production)

**Regions:** Estate lands, noble holdings

**Climate:** Temperate continental

**Primary Breeds:**
- **Cormyrean Black Pig** (estate exclusive, <5% regional)
- **Imported premium breeds** (Goldenfields Heritage, Trielta Forest, 10%)
- **Common farm pigs** (peasant holdings, 85%)

**Production Scale:**
- Noble estates: 20-100 pigs (luxury breeding programs)
- Peasant farms: 2-8 pigs (family subsistence + tax obligation)

**Cultural Significance:**
- **Nobility prestige** - aged ham as wealth display (6-12 month cures)
- Estate specialization (acorn/chestnut forest pannage)
- Tax obligations (peasants owe lord portion of fall slaughter)
- Wedding/feast traditions (whole roasted pigs, aged hams)

**Cormyrean Black Specifics:**
- Prosciutto-style long-cure ham (luxury market)
- Estate smokehouse architecture (multi-year aging)
- Export to Waterdeep, Suzail luxury markets
- Prices: 12-18 sp/lb live, 550-650 sp total value processed

**Market Hubs:**
- Suzail (capital, luxury markets)
- Arabel (trade hub to western Faerûn)
- Estate direct sales (nobility to nobility)

**Economics:**
- Common pork: 2.8-3.5 sp/lb (peasant production)
- Premium estate pork: 8-15 sp/lb fresh
- **Aged Cormyrean ham: 12-18 sp/lb** (luxury preserved)

---

### **CALIMSHAN** (Cultural Scarcity)

**Regions:** Northern Calimshan border regions only

**Climate:** Hot desert to semi-arid

**Primary Breeds:**
- **Calishite Bristleback** (heat-adapted, RARE, <1% regional)
- Pigs largely absent (cultural taboos)

**Cultural Complexity:**
- Many Calishite traditions avoid pork entirely (religious/cultural)
- Northern border regions: Limited acceptance (immigrant populations)
- Bristleback: Exotic specialty, not mainstream

**Production Scale:** Tiny (1-5 pigs, specialist farms, immigrant communities)

**Economics:**
- **Scarcity premium:** 8-12 sp/lb live (extremely expensive)
- Limited demand despite high price (cultural factors)
- Specialty spice-curing traditions (preservation in heat)

**Market Reality:**
Calimshan is NOT a pig region. Bristleback exists as cultural exotic, primarily sold to:
- Immigrant communities (northern Calimshan)
- Curiosity luxury market (Waterdeep exotics)
- Specialty spice-curers (traditional methods)

---

## SEASONAL CALENDAR

### **SPRING (Flamerule/Mirtul, March-May)**

**Activity:** Farrowing (piglet births)

**Market Impact:**
- Fresh pork: Premium prices (+10-15%, limited supply)
- Preserved products: Winter stock depleting, prices peak (+20-25%)
- Breeding stock: High demand (farmers purchasing gilts/sows)

**Regional Variations:**
- Heartlands: March-April farrowing
- The North: April-June (cold delays)
- Calimshan: Year-round (limited)

---

### **SUMMER (Kythorn-Eleasis, June-August)**

**Activity:** Growth season (pasture, forest foraging)

**Market Impact:**
- Fresh pork: Moderate prices (some early slaughter)
- Preserved products: Spring/winter stock sales (+10-15%)
- Live pigs: Growing, not yet market-ready

**Cultural Events:**
- Forest pannage (pigs foraging acorns, mast)
- Cooperative pasture management
- Early harvest pigs (special events, feasts)

---

### **FALL (Eleint-Uktar, September-November)**

**Activity:** **SLAUGHTER SEASON** (primary)

**Market Impact:**
- Fresh pork: Baseline to -5% (PEAK SUPPLY, best buying time)
- Live pigs: Baseline (farmers selling fat stock)
- Preservation supplies: High demand (salt, spices, wood)

**Cultural Events:**
- **Fall slaughter festivals** (community labor, celebration)
- Smokehouse firing (neighborhood cooperation)
- Sausage-making gatherings (family traditions)
- Lard rendering (essential winter prep)

**Why Fall Slaughter:**
1. **Optimal weight** - summer/fall fattening complete
2. **Cold weather** - natural refrigeration, spoilage prevention
3. **Preservation timing** - cure through winter, ready for spring
4. **Economic cycle** - grain harvest feeds pigs, then slaughter

**Regional Timing:**
- The North: August-September (before deep freeze)
- Heartlands: September-October (optimal)
- Cormyr: October-November (estate timing)

---

### **WINTER (Nightal-Hammer, December-February)**

**Activity:** Preservation, curing, product aging

**Market Impact:**
- Fresh pork: Very limited (+15-25%, scarcity premium)
- **Preserved products: Peak sales** (bacon, ham, sausage, lard)
- Cured hams: Aging in progress (3-12 month cures)

**Cultural Significance:**
- Preserved pork sustains communities
- Lard essential (cooking, light, heat)
- Smokehouse maintenance (bacon/ham aging)
- Ham evaluation (tasting for quality, adjusting aging)

**Economic Reality:**
Winter IS the preserved pork market. Fresh pork nearly unavailable (cold prevents slaughter processing). Communities survive on fall-cured products.
