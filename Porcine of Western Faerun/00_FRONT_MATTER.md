## REALISM vs. FANTASY

**Real-World Foundation:**
This guide uses actual swine processing knowledge as the baseline. Yields, primals, and preservation methods reflect reality. If you process a real pig, these percentages work.

**Fantasy Adaptations:**
- Magical preservation (Gentle Repose extends aging time)
- Create Food and Water competes with butcher economics
- Goodberry impacts travel ration market
- Detect Poison protects against spoilage
- Cold climate breeds survive harsher conditions than real pigs

**Game Balance Philosophy:**
Processing pigs should feel rewarding but not break economics:
- Wild Boar hunting = CR 1 encounter + processing + profit
- Preservation = time investment + skill + reward
- Regional specialties = travel/trade opportunities
- Seasonal cycles = campaign timing hooks

## AUTHOR'S NOTES

**On Preservation:**

Pork is fundamentally different from beef. While beef CAN be preserved, pork SHOULD be preserved. 40-60% of a pig's value comes from curing - bacon, ham, and sausage aren't optional luxuries, they're the economic foundation of swine processing.

Fall slaughter isn't arbitrary tradition - it's economic necessity. Pigs fatten on summer/fall abundance, then convert to preserved products that sustain communities through winter. A properly cured ham lasts 6-12 months. Fresh pork spoils in days.

This guide emphasizes preservation throughout because that's how pork actually works. If you ignore curing, you're leaving 50-200% profit on the table and missing the cultural heart of swine farming.

**On Efficiency:**

Pigs are remarkably efficient:
- 72% dressing percentage (vs 60-62% cattle)
- 38.8% retail yield (vs 23% cattle)
- 8-12 hours processing (vs 12-18 hours cattle)
- No aging required (immediate use)
- Lard worth 20-25x more than tallow

A 250 lb pig produces nearly as much usable meat as a 1,200 lb cow (97 lbs vs 280 lbs), processes in half the time, and the fat is actually valuable. For small-scale operations or frontier settlements, pigs often make more economic sense than cattle.

**On Cultural Context:**

Pig farming tells stories. The Neverwinter Northern Pig surviving brutal winters on lard value alone. Goldenfields Heritage commanding bacon premiums that rival beef steaks. Wild Boar being genuinely dangerous (CR 1 isn't a joke - they charge). Calishite Bristleback being exotic because cultural taboos create scarcity.

Use these breeds to build your world. Fall slaughter festivals. Smokehouse traditions. The traveling sausage-maker. The hunter who specializes in wild boar. The luxury ham aging in the noble's cellar for a year before the wedding feast.

**On Game Integration:**

Every breed includes Foundry VTT item counts because "the party processes a pig" should have specific, rewarding results. Exact pricing means you can calculate profit margins. Processing times let you track campaign days. Preservation methods create time-investment decisions.

This isn't just flavor text - it's functional game content that rewards player engagement with the world's economy and culture.
