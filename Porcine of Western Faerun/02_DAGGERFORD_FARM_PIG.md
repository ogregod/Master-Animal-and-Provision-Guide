## PRESERVED PRODUCTS (RECOMMENDED - Major Value Add)

Daggerford Farm Pig is EXCELLENT for all preservation methods. Balanced proportions mean optimal results for bacon, ham, and sausage.

### **BACON PRODUCTION (From Belly)**

**Process:**
1. Cure belly (salt, sugar, Prague Powder #1) - 7 days
2. Rinse and air-dry - 12 hours
3. Cold smoke (apple or hickory wood) - 6-12 hours
4. Rest - 24 hours
5. Slice and package

**Yields:**
- 20 lbs fresh pork belly
- → 15 lbs cured bacon (25% moisture loss)
- → Packaged as 15× (1 lb packages)

**Value Comparison:**
- **Fresh belly:** 20 lbs @ 2 sp/lb = 40 sp
- **Cured bacon:** 15 lbs @ 4 sp/lb = 60 sp
- **VALUE INCREASE: +50% (20 sp profit)**

**Time Investment:** 3-4 hours active labor (curing, smoking) + 7 days waiting

**Storage:** 2-4 months refrigerated, 6-8 months if vacuum sealed

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods, Bacon Production**

---

### **HAM CURING (From Ham Primal)**

**Two Methods:**

#### **Method 1: Short-Cure Smoked Ham (City/Commercial Style)**

**Process:**
1. Injection cure (brine with salt, sugar, Prague Powder, spices) - 2 days
2. Rub cure application - 7 days
3. Soak and rinse - 6 hours
4. Hot smoke (140-160°F) - 8-12 hours until 150°F internal
5. Cool and package

**Yields:**
- 32 lbs fresh ham (both hams)
- → 26 lbs cured smoked ham (19% moisture loss)
- → 2 hams (13 lbs each)

**Value Comparison:**
- **Fresh ham:** 32 lbs @ 2.2 sp/lb = 70.4 sp
- **Short-cure smoked ham:** 26 lbs @ 5 sp/lb = 130 sp
- **VALUE INCREASE: +85% (60 sp profit)**

**Time Investment:** 6-8 hours active labor + 10 days total time

**Storage:** 3-6 months refrigerated

---

#### **Method 2: Long-Cure Aged Ham (Country/Estate Style)**

**Process:**
1. Heavy salt cure (dry rub, 30 days, reapply weekly)
2. Rinse and soak - 24 hours
3. Air-dry in controlled environment (50-60°F, 65-75% humidity) - 3-12 months
4. Monitor, trim mold, evaluate

**Yields:**
- 32 lbs fresh ham
- → 22 lbs aged ham after 6 months (31% moisture loss)
- → 2 hams (11 lbs each)

**Value Comparison:**
- **Fresh ham:** 32 lbs @ 2.2 sp/lb = 70.4 sp
- **Long-cure aged ham:** 22 lbs @ 8-10 sp/lb = 176-220 sp
- **VALUE INCREASE: +150-212% (106-150 sp profit)**

**Time Investment:** 12-15 hours active labor + 6-12 months aging

**Storage:** 12+ months at controlled temperature/humidity

**Note:** Daggerford Farm Pig produces GOOD country ham (not premium like Cormyrean Black, but solid quality). Suitable for 6-month cure; longer cures (9-12 months) possible but not exceptional.

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods, Ham Curing (Short-Cure & Long-Cure)**

---

### **SAUSAGE PRODUCTION (From Boston Butt)**

**Process:**
1. Grind Boston Butt (natural 30% fat / 70% lean ratio - PERFECT)
2. Mix with spices (regional blend - see below)
3. Stuff into casings (natural hog casings or artificial)
4. Fresh, smoked, or cured

**Yields:**
- 14 lbs Boston Butt
- → 12 lbs sausage (trimming loss)

**Sausage Types:**

**Fresh Sausage (Breakfast Links):**
- 12 lbs sausage → 24 packages (8 oz links, 4 links/package)
- Price: 2 sp per package
- Total value: 48 sp
- (vs 14 lbs Boston Butt @ 2.3 sp/lb avg = 32.2 sp fresh)
- **VALUE INCREASE: +49%**

**Smoked Sausage:**
- 12 lbs sausage → smoked 24 hours → 11 lbs smoked sausage
- Price: 2.5-3 sp/lb = 27.5-33 sp
- (vs 32.2 sp fresh = -14% to +2%)
- **Value neutral but extended shelf life (3-4 months vs 3-5 days fresh)**

**Regional Spice Blends (per 10 lbs meat):**

**Heartlands Classic (Daggerford Style):**
- 3 oz salt
- 1 oz black pepper

### **LARD RENDERING**

**Process:**
1. Separate fat by quality (leaf lard, back fat, trim fat)
2. Cut fat into small pieces
3. Render in large pot (low heat, 8-12 hours)
4. Strain solids (cracklins)
5. Cool, package, store

**Yields:**
- 25 lbs raw fat
- → 23 lbs rendered lard (8% loss to cracklins + moisture)
- → 2 lbs cracklins

**Quality Separation:**
- **Leaf Lard:** 8 lbs @ 5 sp/lb = 40 sp (premium, baking/pastry)
- **Standard Lard:** 15 lbs @ 4 sp/lb = 60 sp (cooking, frying)
- **Cracklins:** 2 lbs @ 1.5 sp/lb = 3 sp (fried snack)

**Total Lard Value:** 103 sp (premium product, no additional processing cost beyond time)

**Time Investment:** 2-3 hours active labor + 8-12 hours rendering time

**Storage:** 6-12 months at cool temperature (50-60°F), longer if refrigerated

**Uses:**
- Cooking fat (frying, sautéing - superior to other fats)
- Baking (pie crusts, biscuits - prized by bakers)
- Soap making (saponification)
- Candle making (winter lighting)
- Leather conditioning (waterproofing)

## CULTURAL NOTES

### **Regional Use**

**Western Heartlands (Origin):**
- Foundation of family food security
- Fall slaughter festivals (community cooperation)
- Bacon/ham curing as household skill (passed through generations)

**Sword Coast Cities:**
- Urban meat supply backbone (common, affordable)
- "Good honest pork" - reliable quality, fair prices
- Middle market positioning (not luxury, not low-end)
- Sausage culture (street food, breakfast staple)

**Northern Settlements:**
- Lard critical for winter survival (cooking, light, heat)
- Heavy preservation mandatory (no fresh winter pork)
- Smoking and curing traditions (every household)
- Community smokehouses (shared infrastructure)

**Frontier/Rural:**
- Self-sufficiency focus (most families raise 2-5 pigs)
- Complete utilization - nothing wasted
- Skill transmission (children learn butchering/curing)
- Barter economy (bacon, lard, sausage = currency)

### **Market Position**

**What Daggerford Farm Pig Represents:**
- Baseline against which other breeds are measured
- "Standard" or "typical" means Daggerford Farm characteristics

## BREED COMPARISON CONTEXT

**Daggerford Farm Pig = The Baseline**

When other breeds say:
- "2% more belly for bacon" = compared to Daggerford Farm's 12% belly
- "Better ham for long-cure aging" = compared to Daggerford Farm's good (not exceptional) aging potential
- "Larger size" = compared to Daggerford Farm's 250 lb standard
- "Premium lard" = compared to Daggerford Farm's 4-5 sp/lb lard value

This breed establishes what "normal" means for Western Faerûnian pigs.

## PROFESSIONAL NOTES

**For Beginning Butchers:**
Learn on Daggerford Farm Pig. Forgiving, consistent, teaches fundamentals without exotic complications. Standard proportions mean textbook results.

**For Commercial Operations:**
Volume processing of Daggerford Farm Pig is profitable foundation business. Premium breeds supplement (higher margins), but common pigs sustain operations (reliable volume).

**Quality Reality:**
"Common" ≠ inferior. Well-processed Daggerford Farm Pig produces excellent eating quality. Proper curing makes exceptional bacon and ham. Most customers can't distinguish Daggerford bacon from Goldenfields Heritage in blind tests when both are properly cured.

**Economic Wisdom:**
Preservation transforms value. A 250 lb pig worth 320 sp fresh becomes 438 sp preserved (balanced approach) or 503 sp with long-cure ham. The breed isn't fancy, but the process creates the value.

**Efficiency beats prestige.** Complete utilization of Daggerford Farm Pig (meat + lard + organs + byproducts + preservation) generates better returns than wasteful handling of expensive premium breeds.

**— Thadius Del Irontet**
*"Common pigs, uncommonly well processed, feed families through winter and build sustainable businesses."*

*The bacon from this morning's breakfast? Probably Daggerford Farm. The sausage in last night's stew? Daggerford Farm. The lard in your pie crust? Daggerford Farm. Not glamorous. Just essential.*
