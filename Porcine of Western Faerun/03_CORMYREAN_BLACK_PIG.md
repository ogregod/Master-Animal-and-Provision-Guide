# CORMYREAN BLACK PIG
## Estate Luxury & Long-Cure Ham Excellence

*In Suzail's noble estates, black pigs roam oak and chestnut forests, fattening on mast for 10-12 months before becoming the finest long-cure hams in Western Faerûn. A single Cormyrean Black ham, aged 12 months, costs more than three common pigs. This isn't excess - it's the pinnacle of the curer's art. When you taste prosciutto that melts on the tongue, nutty and sweet, you understand why nobility waits a year.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

---

## PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### **Size & Weight**

**Processing Standard:** 300 lb pig at 10-12 months

**Live Weight by Development:**
- **Standard Finishing** (8-9 months): 260-280 lbs (not optimal - lacks acorn development)
- **Optimal Acorn Finish** (10-12 months): 290-320 lbs (PEAK QUALITY)
- **Extended Finish** (13-14 months): 330-360 lbs (diminishing returns, excess fat)

**Growth Rate:** ~0.9 lbs/day overall (slower growth, but intense finishing last 2-3 months on mast)

**Key Difference from Baseline:** +50 lbs at optimal slaughter (+20% heavier), specifically in ham development and intramuscular fat (marbling).

### **Appearance**

**Color:**
- **Solid black skin with dark bristles** (95% - breed standard)
- Black with white points (feet, snout - 5% - acceptable but less desirable)

**Build:**
- **Long-bodied** (20-25% longer than Daggerford Farm Pig)
- **Deep through ham and shoulder** (muscle development)
- **Heavy-boned** (estate stock, not selected for feed efficiency)
- **Prominent hams** (largest ham-to-body ratio of any breed)

**Distinctive Features:**
- Solid black coloring (breed hallmark)
- Large, floppy ears
- Long snout (forest foraging adaptation)
- Thick bristles (forest protection)
- Visible ham development (rounded, muscular hind quarters)

**Height:** 32-36 inches at shoulder (tallest common breed)

### **Temperament**

**Disposition:** Moderate to independent

- Forest-raised (semi-wild behavior, foraging instincts)
- Less socialized than grain-fed breeds (estate stock, not pets)
- Food-motivated during mast season (acorns, chestnuts)
- Wary but manageable (estate staff experienced)

**Processing Note:** Slightly more challenging than docile breeds (stress management critical for ham quality). Estate butchers skilled in calm handling.

## YIELDS & PROCESSING

### **Processing Yields (300 lb pig)**

**Breakdown:**
```
Live Weight: 300 lbs
↓ (74% dressing - highest of common breeds due to forest conditioning)
Dressed Weight: 222 lbs
↓ (2% trim loss)
Fabrication Weight: 217 lbs
↓ (57% retail cuts - excellent muscling)
Retail Cuts: 124 lbs

Total Retail Yield: 41.3% live to retail (+2.5% over baseline)
```

**Complete Breakdown:**
```
RETAIL CUTS: 124 lbs (41.3%)
- Premium (loin, tenderloin): 40 lbs
- Choice (shoulder, ham fresh): 42 lbs ⭐ (HAM PRIMAL LARGER)
- Standard (belly, ribs): 36 lbs
- Utility (ground, trim): 6 lbs

BYPRODUCTS:
+ Lard: 33 lbs (11% live weight - acorn-finished fat) @ 5-6 sp/lb = 165-198 sp
+ Hide: 18 lbs (6%) @ 1.5 sp/lb = 27 sp (larger, thicker hide)
+ Organs: 10 lbs (3.3%) @ various = 6 sp
+ Bones: 23 lbs (7.7%) @ 0.3 sp/lb = 6.9 sp

USABLE PRODUCTS: 208 lbs (69.3%)
WASTE: 92 lbs (30.7%)
```

**Key Improvements over Baseline:**
- +2.5% retail yield (exceptional muscling + forest conditioning)
- +3% ham primal (23% vs 20% - **HAM SPECIALTY**)
- +1% lard (acorn fat + larger size)
- Lard quality premium (acorn-finished = nutty, sweet flavor)

### **Primal Distribution (Compared to Baseline)**

- **Loin:** 18% → ~40 lbs retail (standard proportion)
- **Ham:** **23%** → ~51 lbs retail ⭐ **(+3% over baseline - KEY DIFFERENCE)**
- **Belly:** 12% → ~27 lbs retail (standard - excellent bacon too)
- **Boston Butt:** 8% → ~18 lbs retail (standard)
- **Picnic Shoulder:** 8% → ~18 lbs retail (standard)
- **Spareribs:** 5% → ~11 lbs retail (standard)
- **Head:** 7% → ~16 lbs (standard)
- **Jowl:** 3% → ~7 lbs (premium guanciale)
- **Feet:** 4% → ~9 lbs (standard)

**Ham Specialization Explained:**
Acorn/chestnut finishing causes selective muscle development in ham primal. The foraging activity (rooting, walking) builds leg muscle while acorn fats infiltrate (marbling). This creates **large, well-marbled hams** perfect for long-cure aging - the hallmark of Cormyrean Black.

**Forest Finish Impact on Flavor:**
- **Acorn-fed pork:** Nutty, sweet, complex flavor (distinctly different from grain-fed)
- **Chestnut-fed pork:** Sweet, delicate, subtle nuttiness (premium finish)
- **Mixed mast:** Complexity (oak acorns + chestnuts + beechnuts = layered flavor)

This flavor development is WHY Cormyrean Black commands extreme premiums - it literally tastes different.

### **Processing Time**

**Total Active Labor:** 12 hours average (+2 hours over baseline)

**Timeline:**
- Initial processing: 2-2.5 hours (larger, heavier animal)
- Chilling: 24-36 hours at 34-38°F (acorn-finished benefits from extended chill)
- Primal breakdown: 2-2.5 hours (careful ham separation - premium product)
- Retail fabrication: 6-8 hours (+1-2 hours for luxury handling standards)

**Labor Cost:** ~48 sp (12 hours × 4 sp/hour journeyman rate)

**Extra Time Justification:**
Estate standard is perfection. Ham separation must preserve optimal shape for long-cure aging (bone-in whole ham). Improper cutting destroys aging potential and wastes 6-12 months of work.

## LONG-CURE AGED HAM PRODUCTION (PRIMARY PURPOSE)

### **CORMYREAN PROSCIUTTO - Estate Tradition**

**Why This Breed Excels at Long-Cure Ham:**

1. **Ham Size:** 23 lbs per ham (vs 16 lbs baseline) = +44% ham weight
2. **Marbling:** Exceptional intramuscular fat (acorn-fed, visible webbing)
3. **Flavor:** Acorn/chestnut finish creates complex, nutty, sweet base flavor
4. **Muscle Structure:** Long, tapered ham (ideal shape for even aging/drying)
5. **Fat Quality:** Acorn fats resist rancidity during long aging (12+ months possible)
6. **Tradition:** 200+ years Cormyrean estate expertise (technique refinement)

**Long-Cure Process (Cormyrean Estate Method - 6-12 months):**

**Dry Salt Cure (30-45 days):**

**Salt Formula (per 100 lbs ham):**
- 10 lbs coarse sea salt (traditional, mineral complexity)
- 2 lbs dark brown sugar (sweetness, cure balance)
- 4 oz Prague Powder #2 (sodium nitrate/nitrite - slow cure)
- 1 oz black peppercorns (whole, cracked)
- 0.5 oz juniper berries (optional, Cormyrean tradition - forest aromatics)

**Process:**
1. **Initial salt pack:** Rub ham with heavy salt (1.5 lbs salt per 20 lbs ham)
2. **Cure storage:** Lay ham in salt bed, pack salt around (38-42°F, high humidity)
3. **Reapply salt:** Weekly inspection, repack with fresh salt (salt draws moisture)
4. **Total cure time:** 30-45 days (1.5-2 days per pound of ham)

**Resting & Equalization (14-21 days):**
5. **Rinse:** Remove all surface salt, scrub clean
6. **Soak:** 12-24 hours in cold water (removes excess surface salt)
7. **Dry:** Hang in cool room (50-55°F), air-dry 14-21 days (pellicle forms, even salt distribution)

**Long Aging (6-12 months):**
8. **Hang in controlled environment:**
   - Temperature: 55-65°F (consistent)
   - Humidity: 65-75% (critical - too dry = case hardening, too wet = spoilage)
   - Airflow: Gentle circulation (prevents mold concentration)

9. **Monthly maintenance:**
   - Inspect for surface mold (normal - white mold = good, scrape others)
   - Check for spoilage indicators (off smell, excessive moisture, discoloration)
   - Rotate position (even air exposure)
   - Document weight loss (target: 30-35% over 12 months)

10. **Evaluation:**
    - **6 months:** Good quality (28-30% weight loss, developed flavor)
    - **9 months:** Excellent quality (32-34% weight loss, complex flavor)
    - **12 months:** Premium quality (34-36% weight loss, intense, nutty, sweet)
    - **18+ months:** Exceptional (rare, estate prestige hams only)

**Yields:**

**6-Month Cure:**
- 46 lbs fresh ham (both hams) → 32 lbs aged (30% weight loss)
- 2 hams (16 lbs each)

**12-Month Cure:**
- 46 lbs fresh ham → 28 lbs aged (39% weight loss, includes trimming)
- 2 hams (14 lbs each)

### **HAM VALUE COMPARISON**

**Fresh Ham vs Long-Cure Aged (Cormyrean Black):**

```
FRESH HAM (both hams):
46 lbs @ 3 sp/lb = 138 sp

6-MONTH AGED HAM:
32 lbs @ 10 sp/lb = 320 sp ⭐
Value increase: +132% (182 sp profit)
Time: 6-7 months total

9-MONTH AGED HAM:
30 lbs @ 12 sp/lb = 360 sp ⭐⭐
Value increase: +161% (222 sp profit)
Time: 9-10 months total

12-MONTH AGED HAM:
28 lbs @ 15 sp/lb = 420 sp ⭐⭐⭐
Value increase: +204% (282 sp profit)
Time: 12-13 months total

ESTATE PRESTIGE HAM (18 months):
24 lbs @ 20-25 sp/lb = 480-600 sp ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Value increase: +248-335% (342-462 sp profit)
Time: 18-19 months total
```

**Pricing Explanation:**

**Why 12-month Cormyrean ham costs 15 sp/lb:**
1. **Time investment:** 12 months aging (opportunity cost, storage)
2. **Shrinkage:** 39% weight loss (must price remaining meat to recoup)
3. **Risk:** Spoilage possible (insurance against loss)
4. **Quality:** Acorn-finished flavor, complex, unique
5. **Scarcity:** Limited production (estate exclusive, small batches)
6. **Prestige:** Cormyrean reputation (200+ years tradition)
7. **Market:** Nobility/luxury (willingness to pay for best)

**Market Comparison:**
- Standard short-cure smoked ham: 5-6 sp/lb
- Goldenfields short-cure: 6 sp/lb
- Trielta Forest 6-month aged: 8-10 sp/lb
- Cormyrean Black 12-month aged: **15 sp/lb**
- Cormyrean Black 18-month prestige: **20-25 sp/lb**

**Where Sold:**
- Cormyrean estate direct sales (nobility to nobility)
- Waterdeep Sea Ward luxury markets (extremely limited)
- Special order only (pre-ordered, not retail stock)
- Gift market (weddings, political gifts, major festivals - extreme prestige)

**Customer Profile:**
- Nobility (exclusive market)
- Royalty (Suzail palace, state dinners)
- Wealthy merchants (status display - "I serve Cormyrean ham")
- Diplomats (gift-giving for treaties, alliances)

---

## BACON PRODUCTION (Secondary Specialty)

Cormyrean Black also produces **exceptional bacon** (acorn-fed advantage).

### **Premium Acorn-Fed Bacon**

**Process:** Standard bacon cure (see Goldenfields Heritage or Daggerford Farm Pig)

**Yields:**
- 25 lbs fresh belly → 19 lbs cured bacon

**Value:**
- Fresh belly: 25 lbs @ 3 sp/lb = 75 sp
- **Acorn-fed bacon:** 19 lbs @ 7-8 sp/lb = 133-152 sp ⭐
- **VALUE INCREASE: +77-103% (58-77 sp profit)**

**Acorn-Fed Bacon Premium:**
Acorn-finished bacon has:
- Nutty undertones (distinctive, complex)
- Firm texture (acorn fat characteristics)
- Sweet finish (acorn sugars in fat)
- Luxury positioning (rarer than Goldenfields)

**Market:** Extreme luxury (Sea Ward Waterdeep, noble estate breakfast). Costs 7-8 sp/lb (vs 6 sp/lb Goldenfields, 4 sp/lb standard).

**Estate Strategy:**
Some estates cure bacon, most focus on ham (longer aging = higher profit margins). Bacon often sold fresh to premium butchers (who cure and brand as "Acorn-Fed Cormyrean Bacon" - fetches 8-10 sp/lb retail).

---

## SAUSAGE & OTHER PRODUCTS (Not Primary Focus)

**Boston Butt Sausage:**
- 18 lbs → 16 lbs sausage
- Fresh: 16 lbs @ 3.5 sp/lb = 56 sp
- (vs fresh Boston Butt: 18 lbs @ 3.5 sp/lb = 63 sp)
- **Not recommended** - sell fresh roasts instead (higher value)

**Lard:**
- Already included in byproducts (170 sp)
- Estate lard sold to specialty bakers (acorn flavor prized for specific applications)

**Specialty Cuts:**
- Jowl → Guanciale (7 lbs → 5 lbs cured @ 10 sp/lb = 50 sp) - exceptional quality
- Head → Headcheese (estate tradition, not commercial)

---

## PURCHASE PRICING

**Live Animal Costs (Cormyrean estates, 1492 DR):**

**Ultra-Premium Rate:** 12-18 sp per pound live weight

**300 lb Cormyrean Black Pig:** 3,600-5,400 sp (360-540 gp)

**Why Ultra-Premium Price:**
- Estate breeding program (200+ year genetics, closed herd)
- Forest pannage (acorn/chestnut finish - land + time investment)
- Extended growth (10-12 months vs 7-8 - additional feeding)
- Brand prestige ("Cormyrean" = luxury, quality guarantee)
- Limited production (estate priority is quality, not volume)
- Proven long-cure potential (buyers know they're getting THE BEST ham genetics)

**Regional Variations:**
- **Cormyr estates (origin):** -10% (3,240-4,860 sp) - estate direct (rare - nobility only)
- **Waterdeep (import):** Baseline (3,600-5,400 sp) - extremely limited availability
- **Neverwinter:** Not available (too expensive, no market)
- **Elsewhere:** Special order only (estate export rare, diplomatic gifts)

**Seasonal Variations:**
Estates don't follow market seasons - production is prestige, not profit-driven. Pricing consistent year-round. Availability: fall slaughter (Sept-Nov) only.

**Volume Purchase:**
Estates do NOT sell volume. Typical sale: 1-2 pigs (specialty butcher pre-order, noble estate purchase). No volume discounts.

**Comparison to Other Breeds:**
- Cormyrean Black: 12-18 sp/lb
- Goldenfields Heritage: 5-7 sp/lb
- Daggerford Farm Pig: 2.8-3.2 sp/lb
- **Premium over baseline: +329-463%**

**Is It Worth It?**

**For long-cure ham production: YES** (if you have facilities + market)
- Purchase: 4,500 sp (avg)
- Net value (12-month ham): 978 sp retail
- But "Cormyrean Ham" brand allows massive markup
- 12-month ham: 420 sp wholesale → 700-900 sp retail (67-114% markup to nobility)
- **Actual net profit (retail): 400-600 sp** (after all costs)
- Plus prestige value (having Cormyrean ham = shop reputation)

**For fresh pork: ABSOLUTELY NOT**
- Purchase: 4,500 sp
- Net fresh value: 638 sp
- **LOSS: 3,862 sp** (total economic failure)

**ONLY buy Cormyrean Black if:**
1. You have 12+ months aging facility (temperature/humidity controlled)
2. Access to luxury markets (nobility, Sea Ward Waterdeep)
3. Capital to invest for 12 months (no revenue during aging)
4. Expertise in long-cure aging (spoilage risk destroys investment)

Otherwise, buy Goldenfields (bacon, faster return) or Daggerford (fresh, immediate profit).

## CULTURAL NOTES

### **Estate Tradition**

**Cormyrean Forest Pannage:**
Noble estates maintain oak and chestnut forests specifically for pig finishing (last 2-3 months before slaughter). This is 200+ year tradition:

**Historical Origin:**
- Pre-Cormyr nobility hunted wild boar in forests
- Domestication began: semi-wild black pigs in estate forests
- Selective breeding: largest, best-flavored for long-cure ham
- Tradition codified: "Cormyrean Black" as estate prestige symbol

**Estate Management:**
- Forests maintained for mast production (acorns, chestnuts, beechnuts)
- Pigs released into forest (Sept-Nov, mast season)
- Supervised foraging (estate staff monitor, protect from predators)
- Final selection (best pigs for estate, others sold to specialty buyers)

**Cultural Significance:**
- Estate wealth display (forest land = luxury, not profit farming)
- Multi-generational investment (oak/chestnut forests = 50-100 years to maturity)
- Family prestige (ham quality = estate reputation)
- Political tool (gifting aged ham = diplomatic gesture)

### **Nobility & Ham Culture**

**Cormyrean Ham as Status Symbol:**

**Wedding Traditions:**
- 18-month aged ham presented at noble weddings (prestige gift)
- Ham sliced during feast (ritual display of quality/age)
- Guest servings (tasting Cormyrean ham = honored guest)

**Political Gifting:**
- Treaty negotiations (aged ham as gesture of good faith)
- Diplomatic missions (representative of Cormyrean quality/culture)
- Royal gifts (to other kingdoms - "Cormyr's finest")

**Estate Competitions:**
- Informal rivalry (which estate produces best ham?)
- Tasting events (nobility sample 12-18 month hams, evaluate)
- Prestige rankings (reputation for ham quality = social standing)

**Succession Heirlooms:**
- Prestige hams aged for years (family patriarch death → aged ham at funeral feast)
- Multi-year aging (some estates age 24-36 months for major events)

### **Market Position**

**"Cormyr for the Ham":**

**What It Represents:**
- Pinnacle of long-cure ham art
- Wealth/status (only nobility affords regularly)
- Patience/tradition (willingness to wait 12 months)
- Quality uncompromising (best genetics, best process, best results)

**Where It Appears:**
- Royal banquets (Purple Dragon Court, state dinners)
- Noble estate feasts (major celebrations only)
- Diplomatic gifts (international prestige)
- Luxury food halls (Waterdeep Sea Ward, extremely limited stock)

**Cultural Saying:**
*"Goldenfields for the bacon, Cormyr for the ham, Daggerford for the family."* - Waterdeep food wisdom

### **Social Class & Use**

**Nobility (Primary Market):**
- Regular purchase (estate to estate trade)
- Prestige display (serving Cormyrean ham = hosting excellence)
- Gift-giving (weddings, politics, major events)
- Competition (who serves the oldest, best ham?)

**Wealthy Merchants (Aspirational):**
- Special occasion ONLY (wedding, major business success)
- Single-slice purchase (1-2 oz tasting @ luxury markets)
- Status striving (serving Cormyrean = "I've made it")

**Common Folk:**
- Never (completely unaffordable - 15 sp/lb = 3 days wages)
- Awareness (cultural knowledge: "Cormyrean ham is the best")
- Aspiration (dream food, never reality)

**Butchers:**
- Specialty shops only (Sea Ward Waterdeep, Suzail luxury markets)
- Pre-order basis (not stocked - too expensive to inventory)
- Estate relationships (need connections to source)
- Prestige anchor (having Cormyrean ham = top-tier shop)

---

## BREEDING NOTES (Estate Management)

**Cormyrean Estate Selection Criteria:**

**Ham Development (Primary):**
- Large, muscular hind quarters (visual assessment)
- Long body (tapered ham shape)
- Marbling (post-slaughter evaluation of breeding stock relatives)
- Bone structure (heavy femur aids aging)

**Acorn Foraging Ability (Secondary):**
- Forest foraging behavior (successful mast finding)
- Weight gain during pannage (efficient acorn conversion)
- Temperament in forest (calm, not aggressive with other pigs)

**Coat Color (Tertiary):**
- Solid black preferred (breed standard)
- White markings acceptable but not desirable (breeding culled if excessive)

**Breeding Program:**
Estates maintain closed herds (no outside genetics for 100+ years). Black pig genetics preserved through selective breeding. Some estates crossbreed (Black × Goldenfields = hybrid vigor, but purists disapprove).

**Breeding Stock Sales:**
Estates rarely sell breeding stock. Occasionally, gilt (young female) sold to allied estates (relationship building). Price: 25-40 sp/lb (7,500-12,000 sp for 300 lb gilt) - investment for new estate herd.

## PROFESSIONAL NOTES

**For Butchers:**

**When to Buy Cormyrean Black:**
- Established luxury market access (nobility, Sea Ward Waterdeep)
- Aging facilities (temperature/humidity controlled, 12+ months capacity)
- Capital reserves (4,500 sp purchase + 12 months no revenue)
- Expertise in long-cure (spoilage destroys entire investment)
- Prestige building (Cormyrean ham = shop reputation)

**When NOT to Buy:**
- Cost-conscious customer base (wasted investment)
- No aging facilities (can't capitalize on ham potential)
- Need quick turnover (12 months too long)
- Inexperienced with long-cure (risk too high)

**Preservation Recommendation:**
ALWAYS long-cure the hams. 6 months minimum, 12 months ideal. Selling Cormyrean ham fresh is economic and professional malpractice - you're throwing away 282 sp profit and destroying the breed's purpose.

**Risk Management:**
Long-cure aging can fail (spoilage, mold, case hardening). Insurance strategies:
- Age multiple hams (diversify risk)
- 6-month evaluation (can stop aging if quality concerns)
- Insurance against loss (some estates offer partial refund if ham spoils - relationship dependent)

**— Thadius Del Irontet**
*"I've processed Cormyrean Black exactly seven times in 132 years. Each time, I aged the hams for 12 months minimum. Three of those hams sold for more than I paid for the entire pig. One 18-month ham funded my smokehouse renovation. This isn't a breed - it's an investment that happens to taste like heaven."*

**— Lady Thessalyn Crownsilver, Cormyrean Noble**
*"Our estate has aged Cormyrean Black hams for six generations. My great-grandfather's final ham aged 24 months before his funeral feast. When we sliced it, the hall fell silent. That ham honored his memory better than any eulogy. This is why we raise black pigs in our forest."*
