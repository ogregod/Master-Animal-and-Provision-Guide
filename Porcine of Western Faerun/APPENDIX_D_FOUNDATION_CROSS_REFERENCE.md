## KEY DIFFERENCES: PORK vs BEEF (Why You Need Both Guides)

### **Processing Differences:**
- **Primals:** 9 porcine (vs 8 bovine) - includes belly (bacon!), separate jowl
- **Yields:** 38.8% retail (vs 23% beef) - pork MORE efficient
- **Aging:** None required (vs 14-21 days beef) - pork FASTER
- **Fat:** Lard 4-5 sp/lb (vs tallow 0.2 sp/lb) - **20-25x more valuable!**

### **Preservation Differences:**
- **Beef:** Smoking, drying (optional - beef sells fresh profitably)
- **Pork:** Bacon, ham, sausage (MANDATORY - pork loses money if sold fresh)
- **Economics:** Pork preservation = profit CREATION (not just shelf life)

### **Economic Model Differences:**
- **Beef:** Can buy retail cattle, process, sell fresh = profitable
- **Pork:** MUST be vertically integrated (raise own pigs OR buy wholesale at 50-60%) to profit
- **Why:** Preservation mandatory, time-intensive (34 hours vs 10), requires cure costs

### **Seasonal Differences:**
- **Beef:** Year-round processing possible (though fall preferred)
- **Pork:** Fall slaughter CRITICAL (cool weather for curing, winter sales premium)

### **When to Use Which Guide:**

**Use Bovine Guide When:**
- Processing beef cattle
- Fresh meat sales (profitable without preservation)
- Dairy economics
- Year-round operations

**Use Porcine Guide When:**
- Processing pigs
- Preservation-centric operations (bacon, ham, sausage)
- Fall slaughter → winter sales cycles
- Lard rendering
- Vertical integration required

**Use BOTH When:**
- Running full butcher shop (beef + pork)
- Understanding comparative economics (why pork requires different model)
- Campaign worldbuilding (regional meat availability)
