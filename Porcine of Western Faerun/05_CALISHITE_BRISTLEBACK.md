# CALISHITE BRISTLEBACK
## Desert Scarcity & Spice-Cured Exotic Pork

*In northern Calimshan, where many traditions avoid pork entirely, a handful of specialist farmers raise heat-adapted pigs that survive desert conditions. The Bristleback isn't raised because it's the best pig - it exists because it's the ONLY pig that can survive Calishite heat. Lean, expensive, culturally exotic, preserved in heavy spice cures. This is pork as curiosity, not commodity.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## QUICK STATS

**Primary Purpose:** Cultural Exotic / Specialty Niche (NOT mainstream)

**Secondary Purpose:** Spice-cured preservation showcase

**Origin:** Northern Calimshan (border regions, heat adaptation)

**Availability:** Extremely Rare - Cultural/religious restrictions limit production

**Climate Adaptation:** Desert/hot arid (survives 100°F+ temperatures)

**Typical Operation Size:** 1-5 head (tiny specialist farms, immigrant communities)

**Market Position:** Exotic Curiosity - Expensive due to scarcity, not quality

**Slaughter Age:** 9-10 months at optimal weight (heat slows growth)

---

## PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### **Size & Weight**

**Processing Standard:** 200 lb pig at 9-10 months

**Live Weight by Season:**
- **Spring/Fall Slaughter** (optimal): 190-210 lbs (moderate temperatures)
- **Summer Slaughter** (challenging): 170-190 lbs (heat stress reduces growth)
- **Winter Slaughter** (rare): 200-220 lbs (cooler temps = better growth, but rare practice)

**Growth Rate:** ~0.7 lbs/day overall (slowest of common breeds - heat stress, limited water, sparse feed)

**Key Difference from Baseline:** -50 lbs lighter (desert conditions = harsh environment, survival prioritized over growth), **extremely lean** (heat adaptation = minimal fat insulation).

**Heat Survival Adaptations:**
- Sparse bristles (reduced insulation)
- Large ears (heat dissipation - blood vessels radiate heat)
- Light skin color (reflects sunlight)
- Minimal subcutaneous fat (insulation disadvantage in heat)
- Efficient water use (desert survival)

### **Appearance**

**Color:**
- Light tan/beige skin (50% - heat reflection)
- White/pink (30%)
- Red/brown (15%)
- Black (5% - rare, heat disadvantage)

**Build:**
- **Lean, leggy body** (heat dissipation - surface area to volume ratio)
- **Large ears** (distinctive - heat regulation, 2x size of temperate breeds)
- **Long legs** (elevate body above hot ground)
- **Narrow frame** (minimal mass = less heat generation)
- **Sparse bristles** (reduced coat - "bristleback" name ironic, actually has FEWER bristles than others)

**Distinctive Features:**
- VERY large ears (most obvious characteristic)
- Visibly lean (ribs sometimes visible - not malnourishment, adaptation)
- Long snout (rooting in hard desert soil)
- Light coloring (desert camouflage/heat management)

**Height:** 30-34 inches at shoulder (taller/leggier than compact breeds)

### **Temperament**

**Disposition:** Independent, heat-stressed, wary

- Desert-raised (harsh environment = survival-focused behavior)
- Heat-sensitive (lethargic in peak heat, active dawn/dusk)
- Water-focused (extreme water motivation)
- Wary of humans (limited socialization, outdoor survival)

**Processing Note:** More challenging than docile breeds (heat stress + independent temperament). Best processed in cool morning hours (dawn, 60-70°F vs midday 100°F+).

## YIELDS & PROCESSING

### **Processing Yields (200 lb pig)**

**Breakdown:**
```
Live Weight: 200 lbs
↓ (69% dressing - lower due to lean adaptation, larger organs for heat management)
Dressed Weight: 138 lbs
↓ (2% trim loss)
Fabrication Weight: 135 lbs
↓ (54% retail cuts - lean, minimal fat trim)
Retail Cuts: 73 lbs

Total Retail Yield: 36.5% live to retail (-2.3% under baseline)
```

**Complete Breakdown:**
```
RETAIL CUTS: 73 lbs (36.5%)
- Premium (loin, tenderloin): 22 lbs (VERY LEAN)
- Choice (shoulder, ham fresh): 23 lbs
- Standard (belly, ribs): 20 lbs (MINIMAL FAT)
- Utility (ground, trim): 8 lbs

BYPRODUCTS:
+ Lard: 12 lbs (6% live weight vs 10% baseline - VERY LOW) @ 3-3.5 sp/lb = 36-42 sp
+ Hide: 12 lbs (6%) @ 0.8 sp/lb = 9.6 sp
+ Organs: 7 lbs (3.5%) @ various = 3.5 sp
+ Bones: 12 lbs (6%) @ 0.2 sp/lb = 2.4 sp

USABLE PRODUCTS: 116 lbs (58%)
WASTE: 84 lbs (42%)
```

**Critical Characteristics:**
- **EXTREMELY LEAN:** Minimal intramuscular fat, thin subcutaneous layer
- **Low lard yield:** 12 lbs vs 25 lbs baseline (-52% lard production!)
- **Tough meat:** Lean = less tender (requires slow cooking, heavy spice/acid marinades)
- **Distinctive flavor:** Slightly gamey (desert diet - sparse forage, different plant profile)

**Economic Reality:**
This is the **worst meat production pig** of common breeds (smallest, leanest, lowest yields). It exists due to **cultural niche + desert survival**, NOT superior quality.

### **Primal Distribution (Compared to Baseline)**

- **Loin:** 16% → ~22 lbs retail (smaller, VERY lean)
- **Ham:** 19% → ~26 lbs retail (smaller, tough - requires moist cooking)
- **Belly:** 11% → ~15 lbs retail (-1% - minimal fat layer, poor bacon potential)
- **Boston Butt:** 8% → ~11 lbs retail (lean, tough)
- **Picnic Shoulder:** 8% → ~11 lbs retail (lean, tough)
- **Spareribs:** 5% → ~7 lbs retail (minimal meat)
- **Head:** 8% → ~11 lbs (standard)
- **Jowl:** 3% → ~4 lbs (minimal fat - poor guanciale potential)
- **Feet:** 4% → ~5 lbs (standard)

**Desert Adaptation Impact:**

**Lean Meat Challenges:**
- **Toughness:** Requires braising, stewing, slow cooking (grilling = dry, chewy)
- **Flavor:** Slightly gamey, distinctive (not necessarily bad, just different)
- **Preservation:** Heavy spice cures REQUIRED (lean meat = risk of drying out, spices compensate)

**Heat-Resistant Processing:**
- Must process in cool hours (dawn, dusk) - midday heat = spoilage risk
- Rapid preservation essential (no refrigeration in desert - must cure IMMEDIATELY)
- Heavy salt/spice = preservation + flavor enhancement for lean meat

### **Processing Time**

**Total Active Labor:** 9 hours average

**Timeline:**
- Initial processing: 1-1.5 hours (smaller animal, lean = faster)
- Chilling: 8-12 hours at ambient (cool night temps, 50-60°F)
- Primal breakdown: 1-1.5 hours
- Retail fabrication: 4-5 hours (less fat trim = faster)

**Labor Cost:** ~36 sp (9 hours × 4 sp/hour journeyman rate)

**Desert Processing Challenges:**
- **Heat:** Must work dawn/dusk (midday = dangerous for meat quality + human)
- **No refrigeration:** Immediate curing/preservation mandatory
- **Water scarcity:** Cleaning/processing uses precious water
- **Spoilage risk:** High temperatures = bacterial growth (speed essential)

- 1 Picnic Roast (bone-in, 6.5 lbs) @ 2.5 sp/lb = 16.3 sp
- 2 Front Hocks @ 1.8 sp each

**HAM (almost always cured - too tough for fresh):**
- 2 Fresh Ham Roasts (11 lbs each, LEAN) @ 3 sp/lb = 33 sp each
- 4 Ham Steaks (1.25 lbs each) @ 3.5 sp each (if not cured whole)
- 2 Rear Hocks @ 1.8 sp each

**Meat Characteristics:**
- Extremely lean (no marbling)
- Tough (requires slow, moist cooking)
- Gamey flavor (desert diet - distinctive but not mainstream)

---

### **STANDARD CUTS (Belly, Ribs - 20 lbs) - MINIMAL FAT**

**BELLY (Poor bacon potential - too lean):**
- 1 Whole Pork Belly (13 lbs, thin fat layer) @ 2.5 sp/lb = 32.5 sp
- OR 2 Half Bellies (6.5 lbs each) @ 2.5 sp/lb = 16.3 sp each

**Belly Characteristics:**
- Minimal fat layer (20% fat / 80% meat vs 50/50 baseline)
- Poor bacon potential (too lean = dry, unappetizing bacon)
- Usually sold fresh OR heavily spice-cured (not traditional bacon)

**RIBS:**
- 1 Rack Spareribs (3 lbs, minimal meat) @ 3 sp/lb = 9 sp

---

### **UTILITY CUTS (Ground, Trim - 8 lbs)**

- 6 Ground Pork packages (1 lb, LEAN) @ 2.5 sp each
- 2 Pork Stew Meat packages (1 lb) @ 2.2 sp each

**Note:** Lean ground pork (must add fat for moisture - desert processing often adds sheep tail fat for culinary traditions).

---

### **SPECIALTY CUTS (Head, Feet, Jowl - 20 lbs)**

- 2 Pork Cheeks (0.4 lbs each) @ 3 sp/lb = 1.2 sp each
- 4 Pork Trotters @ 0.8 sp each
- 1 Pork Jowl (4 lbs, minimal fat) @ 2.5 sp/lb = 10 sp
- 1 Whole Head (if sold, 11 lbs) @ 0.6 sp/lb = 6.6 sp

---

### **BYPRODUCTS (MINIMAL LARD - Major Economic Disadvantage)**

**LARD (Very Limited - Desert Lean):**
- 4 lbs Leaf Lard (small yield, but premium quality) @ 4 sp/lb = 16 sp
- 7 lbs Standard Lard (minimal back fat) @ 3 sp/lb = 21 sp
- 1 lb Cracklins @ 1.5 sp/lb = 1.5 sp
- **TOTAL LARD VALUE: 38.5 sp** (vs 100-150 sp other breeds!)

**Lard Scarcity Impact:**
- 12 lbs lard total (vs 25 lbs baseline = -52% yield)
- Calishite cooking uses sheep/goat fat (pork lard rare, not traditional)
- Limited market (cultural preferences favor other animal fats)

**HIDE (if skinned - thin, light):**
- 1 Hide (12 lbs, thin, large ears) @ 0.8 sp/lb = 9.6 sp

**ORGANS:**
- 1 Heart (0.6 lbs) @ 1.5 sp
- 1 Liver (2.5 lbs) @ 2.5 sp whole OR 0.8 sp/lb sliced
- 2 Kidneys @ 0.8 sp per pair

**BONES:**
- 4 Soup Bone packages (3 lbs each) @ 0.2 sp each = 0.8 sp

---

### **TOTAL FRESH VALUE:**

```
Option A (Bone-In Chops):
Premium cuts: 69 sp
Choice cuts: 75.9 sp
Standard cuts: 41.5 sp
Utility cuts: 19.4 sp
Specialty cuts: 11.8 sp
---
Retail subtotal: 217.6 sp (~218 sp)

Lard: 38.5 sp (VERY LOW)
Organs/hide: 14.4 sp
Bones: 0.8 sp
---
Byproducts subtotal: 53.7 sp

TOTAL FRESH VALUE: 271.3 sp (~271 sp)
```

**Processing cost:** 36 sp (9 hours labor)
**Net value:** 235 sp

**Economic Reality Check:**
- Purchase price: 1,600-2,400 sp (8-12 sp/lb)
- Net fresh value: 235 sp
- **MASSIVE LOSS: 1,365-2,165 sp**

**This pig is NEVER purchased for fresh meat economics.** It's cultural exotic, specialty niche, or immigrant community tradition.

## SPICE-CURED PRESERVATION (Cultural Tradition)

### **CALISHITE SPICE CURE - Heavy Preservation**

**Why Spice-Heavy Curing:**

1. **Lean meat:** Requires moisture retention (spices + salt draw less moisture than salt alone if balanced)
2. **Heat climate:** Rapid preservation mandatory (bacterial growth risk)
3. **Flavor enhancement:** Gamey, lean meat benefits from bold spices
4. **Cultural tradition:** Calishite cuisine = spice-forward (pork preservation follows tradition)
5. **No refrigeration:** Desert conditions = must preserve immediately, intensely

**Calishite Cure Formula (per 10 lbs meat):**

**Dry Rub:**
- 4 oz coarse salt (heavy - preservation priority)
- 2 oz dark brown sugar (moisture retention + sweetness)
- 0.5 oz Prague Powder #1 (safety)
- 1 oz cumin (traditional Calishite spice - earthy, warm)
- 0.5 oz coriander (citrus notes, complements cumin)
- 0.5 oz black pepper (heat, preservation)
- 0.5 oz paprika (color, mild heat)
- 0.25 oz cayenne pepper (heat - optional, taste preference)
- 0.25 oz cinnamon (sweet spice - balances savory)
- 0.1 oz cloves (aromatic, preservation properties)

**Total Spice Cost:** ~8-12 sp per 10 lbs meat (EXPENSIVE - spices costly in desert)

**Process:**
1. **Rub application:** Heavy coating (all surfaces)
2. **Cure time:** 5-7 days (shorter than cold-climate cures due to heat)
3. **Rinse:** Brief rinse (retain spice coating)
4. **Dry:** 12-24 hours (desert air-dry, low humidity)
5. **Hot smoke (optional):** 4-6 hours at 180-200°F (preservation + flavor)
6. **Storage:** Cool, dark location (cellar, shade - avoid direct heat)

**Yields (Ham Example):**
- 22 lbs fresh ham → 18 lbs spice-cured ham (18% moisture loss - less than standard due to spice retention)

**Value:**
- Fresh ham: 22 lbs @ 3 sp/lb = 66 sp
- **Spice-cured ham:** 18 lbs @ 7-8 sp/lb = 126-144 sp
- Spice cost: -18 sp (heavy spice use)
- **NET VALUE INCREASE: +42-60 sp profit** (64-91% increase)

**Storage:** 3-4 months (desert heat = shorter than cold-climate cures)

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods, Hot Climate Spice Curing**

---

### **SPICE-CURED BELLY (Not Traditional Bacon)**

Calishite belly is TOO LEAN for traditional bacon. Instead: **Spice-Cured Pork Belly (Pastirma-Style)**

**Process:**
- Same spice cure as ham
- Dry-cure 5-7 days
- Air-dry heavily spiced (form spice crust)
- NOT smoked (air-dried, spice-crusted)

**Yields:**
- 13 lbs fresh belly → 10 lbs spice-crusted belly

**Value:**
- Fresh belly: 13 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb = 32.5 sp
- **Spice-crusted belly:** 10 lbs @ 6-7 sp/lb = 60-70 sp
- Spice cost: -12 sp
- **NET VALUE INCREASE: +15.5-25.5 sp profit** (48-78% increase)

**Culinary Use:**
- Sliced thin (like prosciutto, not bacon rashers)
- Spice-forward flavor (cumin, coriander dominant)
- Ethnic markets (Calishite immigrants, specialty shops)

## PRESERVATION ECONOMICS SUMMARY

**From One 200 lb Calishite Bristleback:**

### **ALL FRESH (Never Recommended - Terrible Economics):**
```
Retail cuts: 218 sp
Lard: 38.5 sp
Organs/hide/bones: 15.2 sp
---
TOTAL: 271.7 sp

Processing: 36 sp
Purchase: 2,000 sp (avg)
NET: -1,764.3 sp (MASSIVE LOSS)
```

### **SPICE-CURED PRESERVATION (Only Viable Strategy):**
```
PRESERVED:
Spice-cured ham: 135 sp
Spice-crusted belly: 65 sp
Subtotal: 200 sp

FRESH (remaining):
Loin/chops: 70 sp
Shoulder roasts: 28 sp
Ribs: 9 sp
Specialty: 12 sp
Subtotal: 119 sp

BYPRODUCTS:
Lard: 38.5 sp
Organs/hide/bones: 15.2 sp
Subtotal: 53.7 sp

TOTAL: 372.7 sp
Processing/curing: 42 sp
Spice costs: -30 sp
Purchase: 2,000 sp (avg)
NET: -1,699.3 sp (STILL MASSIVE LOSS)
```

**Economic Reality:**
Even WITH preservation, Calishite Bristleback is **terrible investment** from pure economics. It exists for:
1. **Cultural niche** (Calishite immigrants, ethnic communities)
2. **Desert necessity** (ONLY pig that survives heat)
3. **Exotic specialty** (curiosity market, wealthy buyers seeking unusual)
4. **Religious/cultural exceptions** (communities that DO eat pork in Calimshan)

---

## PURCHASE PRICING

**Live Animal Costs (Northern Calimshan border, 1492 DR):**

**Extreme Scarcity Rate:** 8-12 sp per pound live weight

**200 lb Calishite Bristleback:** 1,600-2,400 sp (160-240 gp)

**Why Extreme Price (Despite Poor Quality):**

**Scarcity Factors:**
1. **Cultural restrictions:** Many Calishite traditions avoid pork (limited production)
2. **Tiny production scale:** 1-5 pigs per specialist farm (not commercial)
3. **Environmental challenge:** Desert conditions difficult (high mortality, slow growth)
4. **Limited breeding stock:** Small gene pool (few farmers raise)
5. **Import difficulty:** Temperate pigs can't survive Calimshan (must use adapted genetics)

**NOT Quality Premium:**
This is **scarcity pricing, not quality pricing.** Bristleback is objectively WORSE than Daggerford Farm Pig (smaller, leaner, tougher). Price reflects **you CAN'T get other breeds in Calimshan**, not superior product.

**Regional Variations:**
- **Northern Calimshan (origin):** Baseline (8-12 sp/lb)
- **Waterdeep (import as exotic):** +50-100% (12-24 sp/lb) - curiosity premium
- **Calimshan interior:** Not available (cultural restrictions stronger)
- **Heartlands:** Not imported (no market - temperate breeds superior)

**Seasonal Variations:**
- **Spring/Fall:** Baseline (moderate temps = possible slaughter)
- **Summer:** +20-30% (heat stress = risky slaughter, scarcity)
- **Winter:** -10% (cooler temps = better conditions, rare occurrence)

**Volume Purchase:**
Impossible. Production too small (1-5 pigs per farm, few farms). Single pig purchases only.

**Comparison to Other Breeds:**
- Calishite Bristleback: 8-12 sp/lb
- Cormyrean Black: 12-18 sp/lb (BETTER quality at similar/higher price)
- Goldenfields Heritage: 5-7 sp/lb
- Daggerford Farm: 2.8-3.2 sp/lb
- **Premium over baseline: +186-275%** (WORST value)

**Who Buys This Pig?**

**NOT Commercial Butchers:** Economics are terrible, unless:

**Niche Markets:**
1. **Calishite immigrant communities** (cultural connection, nostalgic)
2. **Exotic food collectors** (wealthy curiosity - "I've tried Calishite pork")
3. **Specialty ethnic restaurants** (authentic Calishite cuisine marketing)
4. **Desert settlements** (ONLY option - no alternative breeds survive)

**Recommendation:**
**DO NOT BUY** unless serving specific ethnic market OR operating in desert environment where no alternatives exist.

---

## CULTURAL NOTES

### **Cultural Complexity (Pork in Calimshan)**

**Religious/Cultural Avoidance:**

Many Calishite cultural and religious traditions **avoid pork entirely**:

**Reasons (Varied):**
- Religious dietary laws (specific faiths - pork forbidden)
- Cultural tradition (generational avoidance, not necessarily religious)
- Climate practicality (pork spoils fast in heat, historically risky)
- Social norms (pork eating seen as foreign, non-Calishite)

**Result:** Pork production in Calimshan is <1% of meat market (goat, sheep, chicken dominate).

**Exceptions (Where Bristleback Exists):**

**Northern Border Regions:**
- Immigrant populations (non-Calishite settlers, trade communities)
- Cultural minorities (communities with different traditions)
- Trade city exceptions (cosmopolitan markets, variety seeking)

**Specialist Communities:**
- Farmers with different cultural backgrounds
- Experimental agriculturalists (heat adaptation research)
- Export-focused operations (raise for northern market export - rare)

**Social Status:**
Eating pork in Calimshan can be:
- **Non-issue** (in cosmopolitan areas, immigrant communities)
- **Curiosity** (exotic food, upper-class experimentation)
- **Social stigma** (in traditional areas, culturally conservative regions)

### **Bristleback as Adaptation Achievement**

**Agricultural Perspective:**

Calishite Bristleback represents **triumph of adaptation over economics**:

**Breeding Achievement:**
- Heat tolerance (survives 100°F+ multi-day periods)
- Water efficiency (desert survival on limited water)
- Sparse vegetation diet (thrives on poor-quality forage)
- Genetic uniqueness (200+ years adaptation, distinct from all other breeds)

**But:**
- Smallest (200 lbs vs 250-300 lbs)
- Leanest (12 lbs lard vs 25-33 lbs)
- Toughest (requires heavy processing/spicing)
- Slowest growth (0.7 lbs/day vs 0.9-1.1 lbs/day)

**Agricultural Saying:**
*"Bristleback proves pigs can survive anywhere. It doesn't prove they should."* - Cynical northern farmer view

**But Calishite Farmer Response:**
*"Your fat northern pigs die in three days of Calishite sun. Bristleback survives and feeds my family. That's not failure - that's success where others can't even try."*

### **Spice Preservation Tradition**

**Calishite Curing Culture:**

Spice-heavy curing isn't just preservation - it's **cultural expression**:

**Spice Blend Traditions:**
- Family recipes (secret ratios, generational knowledge)
- Regional variations (coastal vs interior, different available spices)
- Competition (best spice-cured pork = community pride)
- Culinary artistry (preservation as craft, not just necessity)

**Flavor Profile:**
- Bold, spice-forward (cumin, coriander dominate)
- Heat variable (cayenne optional, taste preference)
- Sweet undertones (cinnamon, brown sugar balance)
- Complex (layered spices vs single-note preservation)

**Market Position:**
"Calishite Spice-Cured Pork" in Waterdeep = **exotic specialty** (ethnic markets, adventurous eaters). Not mainstream, but dedicated following.

### **Immigrant Community Economics**

**Waterdeep Calishite Quarter (Example):**

Small Calishite immigrant community = niche market:

**Demand:**
- 50-100 families (nostalgic for home flavors)
- 1-2 pigs/year per family (special occasions, festivals)
- Total market: 50-200 pigs/year (tiny)

**Supply:**
- 2-3 specialty importers (arrange Calimshan purchase + transport)
- OR 1-2 local farmers attempt Bristleback raising (hot summers, struggle in winter)

**Economics:**
- Import costs: 2,000-3,000 sp per pig (purchase + transport)
- Retail: Sell preserved products at 200-300% markup to immigrant community
- Profit margins: Thin (niche market, small volume)

**Result:** Calishite pork in Waterdeep is **cultural service + marginal profit**, not viable primary business.

---

## BREEDING NOTES (Heat Adaptation)

**Calishite Bristleback Selection Criteria:**

**Heat Tolerance (PRIMARY - Everything Else Secondary):**
- Large ears (heat dissipation - CRITICAL genetic marker)
- Light coloring (heat reflection)
- Sparse bristles (reduced insulation)
- Water efficiency (observational - which pigs survive water scarcity)
- Activity patterns (dawn/dusk active, midday rest = adapted behavior)

**Survival Priority:**
- Desert survival (no selection for growth rate, meat quality, fat content)
- **ANY pig that survives Calishite summer = breeding stock** (extreme selection pressure)

**Breeding Program:**
Extremely small gene pool (few farmers, tiny herds). **Inbreeding common** (limited options), which contributes to small size, health challenges.

**Outcrossing Attempts (Rare):**
Occasional import of temperate genetics (improve size, growth rate):
- **Result:** First generation larger, but CANNOT survive summer heat
- **Solution:** Backcross to Bristleback (restore heat tolerance, lose size gains)
- **Conclusion:** Heat tolerance ALWAYS prioritized over productivity

**Breeding Stock Sales:**
Rare (too few pigs to sell breeding stock). Occasionally gilts sold:
- Price: 10-15 sp/lb (2,000-3,000 sp for 200 lb gilt)
- Buyers: Other desert farmers, experimental northern farmers (attempt summer hardiness)

## PROFESSIONAL NOTES

**For Butchers:**

**When to Buy Calishite Bristleback:**
- **Ethnic market:** Serving Calishite immigrant community (cultural demand)
- **Exotic specialty:** Wealthy clientele seeking unusual (curiosity sales)
- **Desert operations:** Working in Calimshan/hot climates (ONLY viable pig)

**When NOT to Buy (Almost Always):**
- **General market:** Terrible economics, customers prefer temperate breeds
- **Fresh pork focus:** Lean, tough meat inferior to Daggerford Farm
- **Profit priority:** Worst ROI of any common breed
- **Cold/temperate climate:** No advantage, all disadvantages

**Processing Recommendation:**
If you DO buy Bristleback:
1. **MUST preserve immediately** (heat climate = urgent)
2. **Heavy spice cure** (compensates for lean, tough meat)
3. **Market as exotic** (cultural specialty, not mainstream)
4. **Price for scarcity** (not quality - honest marketing)

**Customer Education:**
Be HONEST about Bristleback:
- "Cultural specialty from Calimshan"
- "Lean, spice-cured (not traditional pork flavor)"
- "Exotic curiosity (expensive due to scarcity)"
- **DO NOT claim superior quality** (dishonest, customers will notice)

**— Thadius Del Irontet**
*"I've processed Calishite Bristleback exactly twice in 132 years. Both times for Calishite merchants in Waterdeep who paid ridiculous prices for nostalgic connection to home. The meat was lean, tough, required heavy spicing. I charged 50% premium for exotic handling. They paid gladly, wept during first tasting (childhood memories). That's not about the pig - that's about culture, memory, identity. Bristleback isn't a breed - it's a bridge to homeland."*

---

**— Rashid al-Amir, Calishite Merchant (Waterdeep)**
*"Every year, I import one Bristleback from my cousin's farm in northern Calimshan. It costs 2,500 silver. I could buy three Daggerford pigs for that price, better meat, easier processing. But when I taste spice-cured Bristleback, I'm ten years old again, sitting in my grandmother's kitchen, watching her cure the annual pig with her secret spice blend. That's worth more than economics."*
