# APPENDIX C: PRESERVATION MASTERY
## The Art & Economics of Pork Preservation

*Fresh pork feeds a family for a week. Preserved pork feeds them all winter. This is why preservation isn't optional—it's the entire point of raising pigs.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

---

## WHY PRESERVATION MATTERS FOR PORK

**The Core Truth:** Unlike beef (which can profitably be sold fresh), **most pork MUST be preserved to be economically viable**.

### Economic Reality Check

**Daggerford Farm Pig (250 lbs) - Fresh vs Preserved:**

```
FRESH ONLY (Quick Sale):
Retail cuts: 97 lbs @ 2 sp/lb = 194 sp
Lard: 25 lbs @ 4 sp/lb = 100 sp
Byproducts: 19 sp
SUBTOTAL: 313 sp
Processing labor: 40 sp
NET: 273 sp
Timeline: 2 days

STRATEGIC PRESERVATION (Winter Sale):
PRESERVED:
- Bacon: 9 lbs @ 4 sp/lb = 36 sp
- Cured ham: 15 lbs @ 5 sp/lb = 75 sp
- Smoked sausage: 16 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb = 40 sp
Subtotal: 151 sp

FRESH:
- Chops/tenderloin/ribs: 74 sp

BYPRODUCTS:
- Lard: 100 sp
- Organs/hide: 19 sp

TOTAL: 344 sp
Processing + curing labor: 50 sp
NET: 294 sp (before winter premium)

With winter premium (+20%): 320-340 sp
Timeline: 4-6 weeks
```

**Result:** Preservation adds **17-24% profit** if you have storage and can wait for winter markets.

### Why Pork ≠ Beef

| Factor | Beef | Pork |
|--------|------|------|
| **Fresh profitability** | Yes (aged beef sells premium) | No (must preserve or lose money) |
| **Preservation necessity** | Optional (extends shelf life) | Mandatory (creates profit) |
| **Fat value** | Tallow: 0.2 sp/lb | Lard: 4-5 sp/lb (20x more!) |
| **Yield efficiency** | 23% live to retail | 38.8% live to retail |
| **Processing speed** | 12-18 hours (aging: 14-21 days) | 8-12 hours (no aging) |
| **Primary preserved forms** | Dried, smoked | Bacon, ham, sausage, lard |

**Bottom Line:** Pork's entire economic model revolves around preservation. Master these techniques or don't raise pigs.

## SECTION 1: BACON PRODUCTION MASTERY

**Bacon = The Belly Primal, Cured & Smoked**

Bacon is the **premium preserved product** from pork. A pig's belly fresh sells for 1.5-2 sp/lb. Cured as bacon, it's worth 4-8 sp/lb. This is a **100-400% value increase**.

### Anatomy: The Pork Belly

**Fresh Belly Yield:**
- Daggerford Farm Pig (250 lbs): 9-10 lbs belly
- Goldenfields Heritage (270 lbs): 13-14 lbs belly (thicker back fat = better bacon)
- Cormyrean Black (300 lbs): 14-16 lbs belly (luxury acorn-fed)

**Ideal Bacon Belly Characteristics:**
- **Thickness:** 1.5-2.5 inches (thicker = more slices)
- **Fat-to-Lean Ratio:** 40/60 to 50/50 (even striping preferred)
- **Back Fat:** 0.5-1 inch (protects during curing, adds flavor)
- **Weight:** 10-16 lbs per belly (easier handling)

### The Basic Cure (Equilibrium Curing)

**Ingredients (Per 10 lbs Fresh Belly):**
- Salt: 2.5% by weight = 4 oz (½ cup)
- Sugar (brown or white): 2% by weight = 3.2 oz (⅓ cup)
- **Prague Powder #1** (sodium nitrite): 0.25% = 0.4 oz (2 teaspoons)
  - *CRITICAL: Prevents botulism, gives bacon pink color*
  - *Cross-reference: Master Provisioner's Guide § Curing Salts*
- Black pepper: 1 tablespoon (optional, flavor)
- Optional: maple syrup, honey, spices (personal recipes)

**Equipment:**
- Non-reactive container (ceramic crock, wooden barrel lined with wax)
- Weights (to keep belly submerged if wet-curing)
- Cool storage (40-50°F / 4-10°C) - root cellar, cold room

**Cost Analysis:**
- Salt: 0.5 sp (4 oz @ 2 cp/lb)
- Sugar: 1 sp (3.2 oz @ 5 cp/lb)
- Prague Powder #1: 2 sp (small batch)
- Spices: 1-2 sp (optional)
- **Total cure cost: ~4.5 sp per 10 lb belly**

### Dry Cure Process (Standard Method)

**Day 1: Application**
1. **Trim belly** (remove loose skin, square edges): 10 lbs fresh → 9.8 lbs trimmed
2. **Mix cure ingredients** thoroughly in bowl
3. **Apply cure to all surfaces** (don't skimp - need full coverage)
4. **Place in curing vessel**, cure side down
5. **Refrigerate/cool storage** at 40-50°F

**Days 2-7: Curing**
- **Flip belly daily** (ensures even cure penetration)
- **Liquid will form** (cure draws moisture out - this is normal)
- **Duration:** 7 days for standard belly (1 day per inch thickness)
  - Thick bellies (2+ inches): 10-12 days
  - Thin bellies (1 inch): 5-6 days

**Day 8: Pellicle Formation**
- **Rinse belly** under cold water (remove excess cure)
- **Pat dry** thoroughly
- **Air-dry 4-12 hours** in cool space (forms tacky "pellicle" layer)
  - Pellicle = protein skin that accepts smoke better
  - Should feel sticky but not wet

### Smoking Process

**Cold Smoking (Traditional - Long Shelf Life):**
- **Temperature:** 60-90°F (below cooking temp)
- **Duration:** 6-12 hours
- **Wood:** Apple, cherry, hickory, maple
  - *Cross-reference: Master Provisioner's Guide § Smoking Woods*
- **Result:** Smoked bacon that requires cooking before eating
- **Shelf Life:** 2-4 months refrigerated, 6-12 months if kept cold

**Hot Smoking (Faster - Shorter Shelf Life):**
- **Temperature:** 175-200°F
- **Duration:** 2-4 hours (until internal temp 150°F)
- **Result:** Fully cooked bacon (can eat cold)
- **Shelf Life:** 2-3 weeks refrigerated

**Yield After Curing & Smoking:**
- 10 lbs fresh belly → 7.5-8 lbs finished bacon (20-25% moisture loss)

**Cost Calculation (10 lb Belly → Bacon):**
```
Fresh belly value: 10 lbs @ 1.8 sp/lb = 18 sp
Cure ingredients: 4.5 sp
Smoking wood: 1 sp
Labor (16 hours @ 2 sp/hour): 32 sp
TOTAL COST: 55.5 sp

Finished bacon: 7.5 lbs @ 4 sp/lb = 30 sp
LOSS: -25.5 sp

Wait, what?! This looks unprofitable!
```

### Why Bacon Economics Work (The Missing Piece)

**The key:** You're not buying pork retail to cure—you're **vertically integrated** (raising your own pigs or buying wholesale).

**Wholesale Model (Butcher Buys Live Pig):**
```
Buy Daggerford Farm Pig: 250 lbs @ 2.8 sp/lb = 700 sp

Process entire pig:
- Bacon: 7.5 lbs @ 4 sp/lb = 30 sp
- Ham (cured): 15 lbs @ 5 sp/lb = 75 sp
- Sausage: 20 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb = 50 sp
- Fresh cuts: 54 lbs @ 2 sp/lb = 108 sp
- Lard: 25 lbs @ 4 sp/lb = 100 sp
- Byproducts: 19 sp
TOTAL REVENUE: 382 sp

Processing + curing labor: 50 sp
NET: 332 sp

LOSS: 700 sp purchase - 332 sp net = -368 sp LOSS
```

**Still losing money! What's going on?**

**The REAL Model (Farmer-Butcher):**
```
Raise pig from birth:
- Piglet: 25 sp
- Feed (7 months): 120 sp
- Care/housing: 35 sp
TOTAL RAISING COST: 180 sp

Process entire pig (same as above):
TOTAL REVENUE: 382 sp

Processing + curing labor: 50 sp
NET REVENUE: 332 sp

PROFIT: 332 sp - 180 sp = 152 sp (84% ROI)
```

**Now it makes sense!** This is why:
- Small-town butchers often raise their own pigs
- Large operations buy at wholesale (50-60% of retail live prices)
- You can't just buy retail pork and cure it profitably

### Bacon by Breed (Quality Tiers)

| Breed | Fresh Belly | Cured Bacon | Price/lb | Quality Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Goldenfields Heritage** | 13 lbs | 10 lbs | **6 sp/lb** | **PREMIUM BRANDED** - Thick, even fat, grain-fed sweetness |
| **Cormyrean Black** | 15 lbs | 11.5 lbs | **7-8 sp/lb** | Ultra-luxury acorn-fed, nutty flavor, noble estate specialty |
| **Trielta Forest** | 10 lbs | 7.5 lbs | 5-6 sp/lb | Acorn-finished, country premium |
| **Neverwinter Northern** | 9 lbs | 6.5 lbs | 4-5 sp/lb | Fatty (cold-adapted), excellent for winter |
| **Daggerford Farm** | 9 lbs | 7 lbs | **4 sp/lb** | **BASELINE** - Standard quality |
| **Waterdeep Common** | 11 lbs | 8 lbs | 3.5 sp/lb | Commercial volume, often ground for sausage instead |
| **Calishite Bristleback** | 7 lbs | 5 lbs | 5-6 sp/lb | Lean (hot climate), spice-heavy cure |
| **Wild Boar** | 12 lbs | 9 lbs | 5-6 sp/lb | Gamey, intense flavor, lean |

### Advanced Bacon Techniques

**Maple-Cured Bacon (Premium Variant):**
- Replace 50% of sugar with pure maple syrup
- Adds 2-3 sp/lb to value
- Popular in northern regions (Neverwinter, Mirabar)

**"Goldenfields Bacon" (Branded Luxury):**
- **Must** use Goldenfields Heritage pigs (grain-fed, certified origin)
- Thick-cut slices (⅛ inch vs ¹⁄₁₆ standard)
- Maple cure, apple wood smoke
- Sells for 6-8 sp/lb (50-100% premium over standard)
- **Marketing:** Branded as luxury product (like Champagne vs sparkling wine)

**Slab Bacon vs Sliced:**
- Slab (unsliced): 3.5-7 sp/lb (requires customer to slice)
- Sliced: +1 sp/lb (labor for slicing, convenience premium)

---

## SECTION 2: HAM CURING TECHNIQUES

**Ham = The Hind Leg Primal, Cured & Aged**

Ham is the **most valuable single cut** from a pig when properly cured. Fresh ham: 2-3 sp/lb. Premium aged ham: **15-25 sp/lb** (750% increase for Cormyrean Black).

### Anatomy: The Ham

**Fresh Ham Yield (Hind Leg):**
- Daggerford Farm Pig (250 lbs): 18-20 lbs per ham (2 per pig)
- Goldenfields Heritage (270 lbs): 20-22 lbs per ham
- Cormyrean Black (300 lbs): 24-26 lbs per ham (massive, premium)

**Ham Components:**
- **Top Round:** Leanest section (premium slicing)
- **Bottom Round:** More marbling (better for curing)
- **Shank:** Bone-in, connective tissue (flavor, collagen)
- **Bone:** Femur (can be left in for traditional cure or removed)

**Bone-In vs Boneless:**
- **Bone-in:** Traditional, more flavor, longer cure, harder to slice
- **Boneless:** Modern, easier handling, faster cure, uniform slicing

### Ham Curing Categories

**Three main styles, increasing in complexity and value:**

#### 1. City Ham (Short-Cure, Wet-Brined)

**Method:** Wet brine injection + smoking
**Timeline:** 3-7 days cure + 6-8 hours smoking
**Result:** Fully cooked, ready-to-eat (or reheat)
**Shelf Life:** 2-3 weeks refrigerated
**Price:** 4.5-6 sp/lb
**Best for:** Quick production, immediate sale, tavern use

**Brine Recipe (Per Gallon - Enough for 20 lb Ham):**
- Water: 1 gallon (boiled & cooled)
- Salt: 1.5 cups (12 oz)
- Sugar: ¾ cup (6 oz)
- Prague Powder #1: 1 tablespoon
- Spices: bay leaves, peppercorns, cloves (optional)

**Process:**
1. **Inject brine** into ham (use syringe, multiple injection points)
2. **Submerge in brine** for 3-7 days (refrigerated)
3. **Rinse & dry** (form pellicle, 4 hours air-dry)
4. **Hot smoke** at 175-200°F for 6-8 hours (internal temp 145-150°F)
5. **Ready to eat** (fully cooked)

**Yield:** 20 lbs fresh → 17 lbs finished city ham (15% moisture loss)

**Economics:**
- Fresh ham value: 20 lbs @ 2 sp/lb = 40 sp
- Brine/smoke cost: 6 sp
- Labor (12 hours @ 2 sp/hour): 24 sp
- **Total cost: 70 sp**
- **Revenue: 17 lbs @ 5 sp/lb = 85 sp**
- **Profit: 15 sp** (if vertically integrated - see bacon section for explanation)

#### 2. Country Ham (Short-Cure, Dry-Salted & Smoked)

**Method:** Dry salt cure + cold smoking + short aging
**Timeline:** 25-45 days total (7-10 days cure + 2-3 days smoke + 14-30 days aging)
**Result:** Smoked ham requiring cooking before eating
**Shelf Life:** 3-6 months (up to 12 months if kept cool & dry)
**Price:** 5-8 sp/lb
**Best for:** Winter storage, rural areas, traditional flavor

**Cure Recipe (Per 20 lb Ham):**
- Salt: 2 lbs (coarse sea salt preferred)
- Sugar: 8 oz (brown sugar traditional)
- Prague Powder #1: 2 tablespoons
- Black pepper: ¼ cup
- Optional: cayenne, juniper, herbs

**Process:**
1. **Pack ham in cure** (cover all surfaces, massage into meat)
2. **Cure for 2 days per pound** (20 lb ham = 40 days... wait, that's too long for short-cure!)

Let me correct this:

**Corrected Process:**
1. **Pack ham in cure** (cover all surfaces, massage into meat)
2. **Cure for 1 day per 2 lbs** (20 lb ham = 10 days)
3. **Flip daily** (ensures even cure)
4. **Rinse thoroughly** (remove excess salt)
5. **Soak 2-4 hours** (reduces saltiness)
6. **Air-dry 24 hours** (form pellicle)
7. **Cold smoke 2-3 days** (60-80°F, hickory or apple)
8. **Age 2-4 weeks** in cool, dry space (50-60°F, 60-70% humidity)
9. **Ready for sale** (requires cooking before eating)

**Yield:** 20 lbs fresh → 14-15 lbs finished country ham (25-30% moisture loss)

**Popular Variants:**
- **Neverwinter Northern Ham:** Heavy smoke, minimal aging (fuel-saving in cold climate)
- **Daggerford Country Ham:** Baseline (apple wood, 3-4 week age)
- **Trielta Forest Ham:** Acorn-fed pork, longer smoke, 6-9 month age (transitions to long-cure style)

#### 3. Prosciutto-Style (Long-Cure, Air-Dried)

**Method:** Dry salt cure + extended aging (NO smoking)
**Timeline:** 6-18 months total
**Result:** Dry-cured, thinly sliced, eaten raw (like Italian prosciutto or Spanish jamón)
**Shelf Life:** Years (if kept whole, sliced = 1-2 months)
**Price:** 10-25 sp/lb (highest value pork product)
**Best for:** Luxury markets, noble estates, specialty shops

**The Premium Long-Cure Hams:**

##### **Cormyrean Black Ham (12-18 Month Cure)**

**Why This Commands 15-25 sp/lb:**
- **Acorn/chestnut finish:** Pigs forage in oak forests for 2-3 months before slaughter
- **Intramuscular fat:** Marbling from diet creates nutty, sweet flavor
- **Slow aging:** 12-18 months in controlled cellars
- **Noble provenance:** Only from certified Cormyrean Black estates
- **Artisan production:** Limited quantities, traditional methods

**Cure Process:**
1. **Initial cure:** 2 lbs salt per 25 lb ham, packed for 14-20 days (1 day per kg)
2. **First rinse:** Remove salt, brush clean
3. **Equalization:** Hang 4-6 weeks (salt distributes evenly, excess moisture drips)
4. **Aging chamber:** 6-18 months at 55-65°F, 65-75% humidity
   - First 3 months: Weight loss 8-12% (moisture evaporation)
   - Next 3 months: Weight loss 4-6% (slow drying, flavor concentration)
   - Next 6-12 months: Weight loss 2-4% (final aging, complexity development)
5. **Total weight loss:** 28-35% (25 lbs fresh → 16-18 lbs aged)
6. **Final product:** Firm exterior, ruby-red interior, complex flavor

**Economics (Cormyrean Black Pig, 300 lbs):**
```
One ham: 25 lbs fresh
Cost to raise pig: 800 sp (premium feed, acorn finishing)
Allocation to ham: 20% of pig value = 160 sp

Cure/aging costs:
- Salt/spices: 8 sp
- Aging facility (18 months rent share): 40 sp
- Labor (monitoring, turning): 20 sp
Total: 68 sp

Investment per ham: 160 + 68 = 228 sp

Aged ham yield: 17 lbs @ 18 sp/lb = 306 sp
PROFIT: 78 sp per ham (34% ROI over 18 months)

BUT WAIT - You have 2 hams per pig!
Total ham value: 2 × 306 = 612 sp
Total ham investment: 2 × 228 = 456 sp
HAM PROFIT: 156 sp

Plus rest of pig (loin, belly, etc.): 450-550 sp
TOTAL PIG VALUE: 1,062-1,162 sp
TOTAL PIG COST: 800 sp raising + 120 sp processing = 920 sp
NET PROFIT: 142-242 sp per pig (15-26% ROI)
```

**Why the "low" ROI for such expensive ham?**
- Time cost: 18 months to full value (vs 2-3 weeks for fresh)
- Risk: Aging can fail (mold, improper humidity, spoilage)
- Facility costs: Climate-controlled aging cellars expensive
- Market: Limited customers able to afford 15-25 sp/lb ham
- Prestige: Noble estates produce for reputation, not maximum profit

##### **Trielta Forest Ham (6-9 Month Cure)**

**The "Working Family's Aged Ham":**
- Acorn-fed (similar to Cormyrean Black)
- Shorter aging (6-9 months vs 12-18)
- Less controlled environment (simpler cellars)
- **Price:** 9-12 sp/lb (vs 15-25 sp for Cormyrean)
- **Target market:** Wealthy merchants, minor nobles, special occasions

**Process:**
- Same as Cormyrean Black, but:
  - Shorter aging window (6-9 months)
  - Less frequent monitoring
  - Slightly higher humidity (70-75%)
  - Final weight loss: 22-28% (vs 28-35%)

**Result:** Still excellent quality, but less complexity and concentration than Cormyrean. Think "very good aged ham" vs "transcendent luxury ham."

##### **Goldenfields Heritage Ham (Optional Long-Cure)**

**Grain-Fed Long-Cure:**
- Most Goldenfields pigs → premium bacon (their specialty)
- BUT some producers do long-cure ham (4-6 months)
- **Price:** 8-10 sp/lb
- **Character:** Less nutty than acorn-fed, sweeter (grain diet)
- **Niche:** Those who want aged ham but prefer grain flavor profile

### Ham Selection by Breed

| Breed | Best Ham Style | Aging Time | Price/lb | Notes |
|-------|----------------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Cormyrean Black** | **Prosciutto (long-cure)** | 12-18 mo | **15-25 sp/lb** | LUXURY - Acorn-fed, noble estates |
| **Trielta Forest** | **Country aged (medium)** | 6-9 mo | 9-12 sp/lb | Premium acorn-fed, accessible luxury |
| **Goldenfields Heritage** | City ham (or 4-6 mo cure) | 1 week or 4-6 mo | 5-6 sp/lb (city) / 8-10 sp/lb (aged) | Grain-fed sweetness |
| **Daggerford Farm** | **Country ham** | 3-4 weeks | **5 sp/lb** | **BASELINE** country ham |
| **Neverwinter Northern** | Smoked country ham | 2-3 weeks | 5-6 sp/lb | Heavy smoke, minimal aging (cold climate) |
| **Waterdeep Common** | City ham | 1 week | 4.5 sp/lb | Commercial volume |
| **Calishite Bristleback** | Spice-cured | 2-4 weeks | 6-8 sp/lb | Lean, heavy spices (desert preservation) |
| **Wild Boar** | Smoked ham | 2-3 weeks | 6-7 sp/lb | Gamey, intense, lean |

### Ham Storage & Handling

**Whole Hams (Uncut):**
- **City ham (cooked):** 2-3 weeks refrigerated, 3-4 months frozen
- **Country ham (smoked):** 3-6 months hanging in cool, dry space
- **Long-cure (prosciutto-style):** Years if whole, sliced within 1-2 months

**Sliced Ham:**
- **Fresh-sliced:** 3-5 days refrigerated
- **Vacuum-sealed:** 2-3 weeks refrigerated

**Traditional Storage (Pre-Refrigeration):**
- Wrap in cloth, hang in root cellar or smokehouse
- Temperature: 45-55°F
- Humidity: 60-70%
- **Duration:** 3-12 months depending on cure intensity

## SECTION 3: SAUSAGE MAKING

**Sausage = Ground Meat + Fat + Spices + Casing**

Sausage is the **efficiency play** in pork preservation. It uses:
- Trimmings from other cuts (would be wasted or low-value)
- Tougher cuts (shoulder, jowl) ground tender
- Fat (controlled ratios for flavor/texture)

**Economic Advantage:** Converts 1.5 sp/lb trim into 2.5-4 sp/lb sausage.

### Sausage Categories

#### 1. Fresh Sausage (No Curing)

**Definition:** Raw ground meat, seasoned, in casings, **must be cooked before eating**
**Shelf Life:** 3-5 days refrigerated, 2-3 months frozen
**Price:** 2-2.5 sp/lb
**Examples:** Breakfast sausage, Italian sausage, bratwurst

**Basic Fresh Sausage Recipe (10 lbs):**
```
Meat & Fat:
- Pork shoulder (Boston Butt): 7 lbs (lean)
- Pork fat (back fat or jowl): 3 lbs
- TARGET RATIO: 70% lean / 30% fat

Seasonings (Basic Breakfast Sausage):
- Salt: 3 tablespoons (1.5% by weight)
- Black pepper: 2 tablespoons
- Sage: 2 tablespoons (dried)
- Thyme: 1 tablespoon
- Red pepper flakes: 1 teaspoon (optional heat)
- Brown sugar: 2 tablespoons (optional sweetness)

Casings:
- Hog casings: 10-12 feet (for 10 lbs meat)
- OR bulk (no casing): breakfast patties
```

**Process:**
1. **Cube meat & fat** (1-inch pieces)
2. **Keep COLD** (near-freezing - prevents fat smearing)
3. **Grind** through medium plate (⅜ inch holes)
4. **Mix seasonings** (don't overwork - causes tough texture)
5. **Stuff casings** (or form patties)
6. **Refrigerate** or freeze

**Yield:** 10 lbs meat → 10 lbs sausage (fresh = no moisture loss)

**Cost (Per 10 lbs):**
- Shoulder meat: 7 lbs @ 1.5 sp/lb = 10.5 sp
- Fat: 3 lbs @ 0.8 sp/lb = 2.4 sp
- Seasonings: 2 sp
- Casings: 1.5 sp
- Labor (3 hours @ 2 sp/hour): 6 sp
**Total: 22.4 sp**

**Revenue:** 10 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb = 25 sp
**Profit: 2.6 sp** (12% margin - not great, but uses trimmings!)

**Popular Fresh Sausage Variants:**

| Style | Seasoning Profile | Regional Origin | Price/lb |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Breakfast Sausage** | Sage, thyme, black pepper | Daggerford, Neverwinter | 2.5 sp/lb |
| **Italian Sweet** | Fennel, garlic, sweet basil | Waterdeep (immigrant) | 2.8 sp/lb |
| **Italian Hot** | Fennel, garlic, red pepper flakes | Waterdeep | 2.8 sp/lb |
| **Bratwurst** | White pepper, mace, ginger, nutmeg | Neverwinter (northern) | 3 sp/lb |
| **Chorizo** | Paprika, cumin, chili, vinegar | Calimshan | 3.5 sp/lb |

#### 2. Smoked Sausage (Cured & Smoked)

**Definition:** Fresh sausage + cure + cold/hot smoking
**Shelf Life:** 2-3 weeks refrigerated, 4-6 months frozen, 2-3 months hanging (if cold-smoked)
**Price:** 3-4 sp/lb
**Examples:** Kielbasa, smoked bratwurst, andouille

**Process Additions (vs Fresh):**
- Add **Prague Powder #1** to seasoning mix (1 teaspoon per 5 lbs)
- **Cure overnight** in refrigerator after stuffing (12-24 hours)
- **Cold smoke** 4-8 hours (80-90°F) OR **hot smoke** 2-4 hours (175-200°F)
- Yield: 10 lbs fresh → 8.5-9 lbs smoked (10-15% moisture loss)

**Economics:**
- Same base cost as fresh: 22.4 sp
- Plus cure/smoke: 3 sp
- Plus extra labor (8 hours @ 2 sp/hour): 16 sp
**Total: 41.4 sp**

**Revenue:** 9 lbs @ 3.5 sp/lb = 31.5 sp
**LOSS: -9.9 sp**

**Wait, smoked sausage loses money?!**

Yes, if you're buying meat retail. **Smoked sausage only works if:**
1. Using trimmings from whole-pig processing (effectively free meat)
2. Vertically integrated (raising own pigs)
3. Premium pricing for artisan/branded products

**The Whole-Pig Model (Why Sausage Works):**
```
Process Daggerford Farm Pig (250 lbs):

High-value cuts (sold fresh or cured):
- Loin (chops, tenderloin): 32 lbs @ 3 sp/lb = 96 sp
- Belly (bacon): 9 lbs → 7 lbs bacon @ 4 sp/lb = 28 sp
- Ham (cured): 36 lbs → 30 lbs @ 5 sp/lb = 150 sp

Trim & sausage cuts (would be low-value otherwise):
- Boston Butt: 14 lbs (could sell as roast @ 2 sp/lb = 28 sp OR make sausage)
- Picnic shoulder: 14 lbs (roast @ 1.8 sp/lb = 25.2 sp OR sausage)
- Trim/fat: 12 lbs (nearly worthless fresh @ 0.8 sp/lb = 9.6 sp OR sausage)
TOTAL if sold fresh: 62.8 sp

If ground into sausage:
- 40 lbs meat → 35 lbs smoked sausage @ 3.5 sp/lb = 122.5 sp
- Cure/smoke/labor cost: 25 sp
- NET: 97.5 sp

SAUSAGE ADVANTAGE: +34.7 sp per pig (55% value increase from trim!)
```

**This is why sausage matters:** It's the **value recovery** from parts that would otherwise be wasted or sold cheap.

#### 3. Dry-Cured Sausage (Aged Salami)

**Definition:** Cured, fermented, air-dried sausage (eaten without cooking)
**Shelf Life:** 3-6 months hanging, years if vacuum-sealed
**Price:** 5-8 sp/lb
**Examples:** Salami, pepperoni, soppressata, chorizo (Spanish dry-cured style)

**This is ADVANCED** and requires:
- **Prague Powder #2** (sodium nitrite + nitrate for long cure)
- **Starter culture** (beneficial bacteria for fermentation)
- **Precise temperature/humidity control** (50-60°F, 70-80% humidity for 4-8 weeks)
- **High risk of failure** (mold, spoilage, case hardening)

**I will not detail full process here** (beyond scope - this is artisan specialty). Key points:
- **Timeline:** 4-12 weeks drying
- **Weight loss:** 30-40% (10 lbs fresh → 6-7 lbs dried)
- **Price premium:** 5-8 sp/lb (reflects time, skill, risk)
- **Best for:** Specialty shops, luxury markets, long-term storage

**Breeds Best for Dry-Cured Sausage:**
- Cormyrean Black (acorn-fed = complex flavor)
- Trielta Forest (acorn-fed, country artisan)
- Wild Boar (intense gamey flavor)

### Fat-to-Lean Ratios by Sausage Type

| Sausage Type | Lean % | Fat % | Why This Ratio |
|--------------|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Fresh breakfast** | 70% | 30% | Standard (tender, juicy, not greasy) |
| **Italian** | 75% | 25% | Leaner (fennel flavor forward) |
| **Bratwurst** | 65% | 35% | Richer (traditional German style) |
| **Smoked kielbasa** | 70% | 30% | Balanced (smoke penetration) |
| **Dry salami** | 60% | 40% | Fat needed for slow cure (prevents drying out) |
| **Wild boar sausage** | 80% | 20% | Wild boar lean, add pork fat to compensate |

**Key Rule:** Too little fat = dry, crumbly. Too much fat = greasy, falls apart. 70/30 is safe baseline.

### Sausage Economics by Breed

**Best Breeds for Sausage:**

| Breed | Why Good for Sausage | Sausage Yield (from 250 lb pig) | Value |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **Waterdeep Common** | **HIGHEST YIELD** - Urban waste-fed, 60% of pig → sausage | 48 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb | 120 sp |
| **Daggerford Farm** | Balanced, good trim/fat ratio | 35 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb | 87.5 sp |
| **Neverwinter Northern** | High fat (great for rich sausage) | 38 lbs @ 3 sp/lb | 114 sp |
| **Wild Boar** | Premium gamey flavor (mix with pork fat) | 32 lbs @ 4 sp/lb | 128 sp |

**Worst Breed for Sausage:**
- **Calishite Bristleback:** Too lean (desert-adapted), needs added fat, low yield

### Spice Blends (Regional Variations)

**Neverwinter Northern Breakfast Sausage:**
- Sage, thyme, black pepper, **maple syrup** (2 tablespoons per 10 lbs)
- Cold-climate comfort food
- 2.5-3 sp/lb

**Waterdeep "Dock District" Sausage:**
- Garlic, fennel, red pepper flakes, **fish sauce** (umami bomb)
- Working-class favorite
- 2 sp/lb (cheap, filling)

**Baldur's Gate Spiced Sausage:**
- Coriander, cumin, cinnamon, ginger (trade route spices)
- Exotic flavor, merchant-class
- 3-3.5 sp/lb

**Calishite Merguez:**
- Harissa, cumin, coriander, paprika, garlic (HOT)
- Lamb traditionally, but pork version exists in multicultural cities
- 4-5 sp/lb (spice cost)

## SECTION 4: LARD RENDERING

**Lard = Rendered Pork Fat (The Secret Goldmine)**

Lard is **20-25x more valuable than beef tallow** (4-5 sp/lb vs 0.2 sp/lb). This is because:
1. **Superior cooking fat:** High smoke point, neutral flavor, flaky pastries
2. **Scarcity:** Pigs yield less fat than cattle by total volume (but higher value per lb)
3. **Premium grades:** Leaf lard (internal kidney fat) is HIGHLY prized

**Yield by Breed:**
- Standard (Daggerford Farm): 25 lbs lard (10% live weight)
- **Neverwinter Northern:** 28 lbs lard (12% live weight) - LARD SPECIALIST
- Calishite Bristleback: 15 lbs lard (7.5% live weight) - desert lean

### Lard Grades (Quality Hierarchy)

#### **Grade 1: Leaf Lard (PREMIUM)**

**Source:** Internal fat around kidneys and loin
**Characteristics:**
- Pure white color
- NO pork flavor (neutral)
- Highest smoke point (375°F)
- Creamy texture

**Yield:** 4-6 lbs per pig (only ~20% of total lard)

**Uses:**
- Pie crusts (flakiest possible)
- Pastries
- Luxury baking
- Alchemy (base for ointments, salves)

**Price:** **5-7 sp/lb** (premium bakers pay top dollar)

**Why So Valuable:**
- Scarcity (small yield per pig)
- Unmatched baking performance (vs butter or other fats)
- Shelf life (6-12 months refrigerated, 1-2 years frozen)

#### **Grade 2: Back Fat / Fatback Lard**

**Source:** Subcutaneous fat from back and sides
**Characteristics:**
- Off-white to pale yellow
- Mild pork flavor
- Good smoke point (360°F)

**Yield:** 15-20 lbs per pig (~65% of total lard)

**Uses:**
- General cooking (frying, sautéing)
- Sausage making (added fat)
- Soap making
- Candles (burns clean)

**Price:** **4-5 sp/lb** (standard lard)

#### **Grade 3: Caul Fat / Trim Lard**

**Source:** Membrane fat, trimmings, organ fat
**Characteristics:**
- Yellow-tan color
- Noticeable pork flavor
- Lower smoke point (340°F)

**Yield:** 4-6 lbs per pig (~15-20% of total lard)

**Uses:**
- Soap making
- Candles
- Leather treatment
- Animal feed supplement

**Price:** **2-3 sp/lb** (utility grade)

### Rendering Process (Wet vs Dry)

#### **Wet Rendering (Foolproof, Lower Quality)**

**Method:** Boil fat in water

**Process:**
1. **Cube fat** into 1-inch pieces
2. **Add to pot** with water (1 cup water per 5 lbs fat)
3. **Simmer** on low heat 2-4 hours (don't boil hard)
4. **Strain** through cheesecloth into containers
5. **Cool** (lard floats to top, water settles below)
6. **Remove solid lard**, discard water

**Yield:** 10 lbs fat → 7.5-8 lbs lard (75-80% yield)

**Pros:** Can't burn, easy for beginners
**Cons:** Slightly darker color, more pork flavor (water extracts some proteins)

**Best for:** Grade 2 & 3 lard, soap/candle making

#### **Dry Rendering (Premium Quality)**

**Method:** Cook fat in its own rendering liquid

**Process:**
1. **Cube fat** into ½-inch pieces (smaller = faster)
2. **Add to heavy pot** (cast iron ideal)
3. **Low heat** (200-250°F) for 3-6 hours
   - Stir occasionally
   - Fat will melt, cracklings will float
4. **Monitor carefully** (don't let cracklings brown - that's too hot!)
5. **Strain** through cheesecloth when fully liquid
6. **Pour into containers** (ceramic crocks, glass jars)

**Yield:** 10 lbs fat → 8-8.5 lbs lard (80-85% yield)

**Pros:** Purest white color, mildest flavor (essential for leaf lard)
**Cons:** Can burn if not watched, requires skill

**Best for:** Grade 1 leaf lard (premium)

### Byproduct: Cracklings (Bonus Revenue!)

**Cracklings = Crispy bits left after rendering**

**What They Are:**
- Connective tissue, small meat bits, rendered skin
- Crispy, salty, porky (like bacon bits)

**Yield:** 10 lbs fat → 1-2 lbs cracklings

**Uses:**
- Snack food (salted, eaten like chips)
- Cornbread additive (Southern/rural tradition)
- Animal feed (high protein)

**Price:** 1-2 sp/lb (working-class treat)

**Total Lard Revenue (Neverwinter Northern Pig, 235 lbs):**
```
Leaf lard: 6 lbs @ 6 sp/lb = 36 sp
Back fat lard: 18 lbs @ 4.5 sp/lb = 81 sp
Trim lard: 4 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb = 10 sp
Cracklings: 2 lbs @ 1.5 sp/lb = 3 sp

TOTAL LARD VALUE: 130 sp

Rendering cost:
- Fuel (wood): 2 sp
- Labor (8 hours @ 2 sp/hour): 16 sp
Total: 18 sp

NET: 112 sp from lard alone!

For context: The entire pig's MEAT might be worth 200-250 sp fresh.
Lard = 45-55% of the pig's total value in cold climates!
```

**This is why Neverwinter Northern pigs are raised:** Winter fat is survival currency.

### Lard Storage & Shelf Life

**Proper Storage:**
- Containers: Ceramic crocks, glass jars, wooden barrels (wax-lined)
- **Keep airtight** (prevents rancidity from oxygen exposure)
- **Cool & dark** (root cellar, pantry, NOT warm kitchen)

**Shelf Life:**
- Room temperature (60-70°F): 3-6 months
- **Refrigerated (40°F):** 6-12 months
- **Frozen:** 1-2 years
- **Salted lard (traditional):** Add 1 tablespoon salt per lb (extends to 12+ months at room temp)

**Signs of Rancidity:**
- Off smell (sour, painty, like old crayons)
- Yellow discoloration (fresh lard is white to pale cream)
- Taste: bitter or metallic

**Rancid lard is NOT DANGEROUS, just unpalatable.** Can still be used for soap/candles.

### Lard vs Other Fats (Comparison)

| Fat | Price/lb | Smoke Point | Best Use | Flavor |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Leaf Lard** | 5-7 sp/lb | 375°F | Baking (pie crusts) | Neutral |
| **Standard Lard** | 4-5 sp/lb | 360°F | Frying, cooking | Mild pork |
| **Butter** | 6-8 sp/lb | 350°F | Baking, flavor | Rich dairy |
| **Beef Tallow** | 0.2 sp/lb | 400°F | Frying, candles | Beefy |
| **Olive Oil** | 10-15 sp/lb | 375°F | Cooking, salads | Fruity |
| **Vegetable Oil** | 3-4 sp/lb | 400-450°F | Frying | Neutral |

**Why Lard Commands Premium:**
- Baking performance (flaky pastries > all other fats)
- Scarcity (pigs yield less total fat than cattle, sheep)
- Cultural preference (regional cuisines prize lard)

## SECTION 5: SPECIALTY PRODUCTS

### Guanciale (Cured Jowl)

**What:** Pork jowl (cheek), cured like bacon
**Origin:** Specialty Italian-style product (rare in Faerûn, found in cosmopolitan cities)
**Uses:** Carbonara, amatriciana (pasta dishes), sliced thin and fried

**Yield:** 3-4 lbs per pig (one jowl per side)

**Process:**
- Same as bacon (dry cure 7-10 days)
- NO smoking (traditional guanciale is unsmoked)
- Air-dry 3-4 weeks after cure

**Yield:** 3 lbs fresh → 2 lbs cured (33% moisture loss)

**Price:** 6-8 sp/lb (specialty product, limited supply)

**Economics:**
- Fresh jowl value: 3 lbs @ 1 sp/lb = 3 sp
- Cure/age cost: 4 sp
- Cured value: 2 lbs @ 7 sp/lb = 14 sp
- **Profit: 7 sp per pig** (if you have specialty market)

**Realistically:** Most butchers render jowl into lard or grind for sausage (easier to sell). Guanciale is artisan specialty.

### Headcheese (Brawn)

**What:** NOT cheese - jellied loaf made from head meat
**Origin:** Peasant food (use every part of the pig)
**Uses:** Sliced cold, eaten with bread, mustard

**Ingredients:**
- Pig's head (20-25 lbs): meat, skin, tongue, ears
- Aromatics: onion, garlic, bay, peppercorns
- Natural gelatin from simmering (no additives needed)

**Process:**
1. **Simmer head** 4-6 hours (until meat falls off bone)
2. **Pick meat** from skull (tedious, labor-intensive)
3. **Chop meat** coarsely
4. **Reduce cooking liquid** (concentrates gelatin)
5. **Mix meat + liquid** in molds
6. **Refrigerate** overnight (sets into jelly)

**Yield:** 20 lb head → 8-10 lbs headcheese

**Price:** 1.5-2 sp/lb (working-class food)

**Economics:**
- Head value (alternative: render for lard/trim): 5 sp
- Labor (8 hours @ 2 sp/hour): 16 sp
- Headcheese value: 9 lbs @ 1.8 sp/lb = 16.2 sp
- **LOSS: -4.8 sp**

**Why make it?** Cultural tradition, zero waste philosophy. Not profitable unless you have captive market (tavern serving working-class clientele).

### Pickled Trotters (Pigs' Feet)

**What:** Pig's feet, brined and pickled
**Uses:** Bar snack, peasant food, collagen source (health tonic)

**Yield:** 4 feet per pig (2-3 lbs total)

**Process:**
1. **Clean feet** thoroughly (remove hair, debris)
2. **Simmer** 3-4 hours (until tender)
3. **Pack in brine** (vinegar, salt, spices)
4. **Age** 1-2 weeks

**Price:** 0.5-1 sp/lb (cheap bar snack)

**Economics:** Breakeven at best. Mainly a way to use otherwise discarded parts.

### Blood Sausage (Black Pudding)

**What:** Sausage made from pig's blood, fat, grain filler
**Origin:** Traditional peasant food (uses blood from slaughter)

**Yield:** 1 pig produces ~4 lbs blood

**Process:**
1. **Collect blood** during slaughter (must be fresh, stirred to prevent clotting)
2. **Mix** with cooked grain (barley, oats), diced fat, spices
3. **Stuff** into casings
4. **Simmer** 30 minutes (until set)

**Price:** 1.5-2 sp/lb

**Cultural Notes:**
- Common in northern regions (Neverwinter, Mirabar)
- Considered "poor food" by upper classes
- Highly perishable (3-5 days fresh, 1-2 weeks if smoked)

**Economics:** Uses otherwise wasted blood. Small profit margin, but part of "whole animal" utilization.

## SECTION 6: PRESERVATION ECONOMICS

### The Preservation Decision Tree

**When to Preserve vs Sell Fresh:**

#### **Sell Fresh When:**
- ✅ **Immediate cash needed** (can't wait 3-6 weeks for cure)
- ✅ **No storage** (no cool cellar, smokehouse, aging facility)
- ✅ **Limited labor** (preservation is time-intensive)
- ✅ **Guaranteed buyer** (tavern, noble house, large order)
- ✅ **Summer slaughter** (fresh sells better in warm weather)

#### **Preserve When:**
- ✅ **Fall slaughter** (traditional - winter demand for preserved)
- ✅ **Storage available** (root cellar, smokehouse, aging room)
- ✅ **Winter market access** (can sell when fresh pork scarce)
- ✅ **Premium breeds** (Goldenfields, Cormyrean - waste of potential to sell fresh)
- ✅ **Vertically integrated** (raising own pigs - capture preservation margin)

### Seasonal Timing (CRITICAL for Pork)

**The Traditional Pork Calendar:**

#### **Fall Slaughter (Uktar - October/November)**

**Why This is PEAK Pork Season:**
1. **Pigs at target weight** (spring birth → 7-9 months old in fall)
2. **Cool weather** (ideal for curing - 40-55°F)
3. **Winter storage** (cold = natural refrigeration)
4. **Winter demand** (preserved meats fetch premium in Alturiak/Ches)

**What to Cure in Fall:**
- **Bacon:** Cure in Uktar → ready by Nightal (2-3 weeks)
- **Country ham:** Cure in Uktar → ready by Hammer (4-6 weeks)
- **Long-cure ham:** Cure in Uktar → ready NEXT FALL (12 months)
- **Sausage:** Smoke in Uktar → sell through winter
- **Lard:** Render in Uktar → sells all winter (heating, cooking)

**Pricing:**
- Fresh pork in Uktar: Baseline (supply glut)
- Preserved pork in Hammer/Alturiak: +15-25% (scarcity premium)

#### **Winter Sales (Hammer, Alturiak, Ches - January-March)**

**Market Dynamics:**
- **Fresh pork:** Scarce (no one slaughtering in winter)
- **Preserved pork:** Peak demand (households need stored food)
- **Lard:** HIGHEST demand (cooking, heating, light)

**Pricing:**
- Fresh pork: +20-30% IF available (rare)
- Bacon: +10-15%
- Ham: +15-20%
- **Lard: +20-25%** (winter survival essential in north)
- Sausage: Baseline (abundant from fall)

#### **Spring/Summer (Tarsakh-Eleasis - April-August)**

**Market Dynamics:**
- **Fresh pork:** Limited (only early-born pigs reaching weight)
- **Preserved pork:** Stockpiles from fall declining
- **Demand:** Lower (warmer = less caloric need, fresh vegetables available)

**Pricing:**
- Fresh pork: +5-10% (some scarcity)
- Preserved: Baseline to -5% (competing with fresh vegetables, fish)

**Strategic Move:** This is when you CONSUME preserved stock or sell at discount to clear inventory before spoilage.

### Regional Pricing Modifiers

#### **Northern Regions (Neverwinter, Mirabar, Icewind Dale)**

**Factors:**
- Long winters (7-9 months of cold)
- High lard demand (heating, cooking)
- Preservation essential (no fresh meat for months)

**Pricing:**
- **Lard: +25-40%** (survival good)
- **Bacon: +10-15%** (calorie density valued)
- **Smoked sausage: +15-20%** (shelf-stable protein)
- Long-cure ham: Baseline (luxury is luxury everywhere)

#### **Southern Regions (Amn, Calimshan)**

**Factors:**
- Hot climate (preservation difficult)
- Fresh pork rare (pigs don't thrive in heat)
- Import costs high

**Pricing:**
- **Fresh pork: +30-50%** (extreme scarcity)
- **Calishite Bristleback: +40-60%** (local specialty, cultural desert pig)
- Preserved: +20-30% (import costs, scarcity)
- Lard: Baseline (less demand for heating)

#### **Urban Centers (Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate)**

**Factors:**
- Large population (steady demand)
- Vertical integration (Waterdeep Common hogs)
- Volume sales (taverns, inns, merchants)

**Pricing:**
- Fresh pork: Baseline to -5% (high supply)
- **Sausage: -10 to -15%** (commercial volume, Waterdeep Common specialty)
- Bacon: Baseline
- Premium products (Goldenfields, Cormyrean): +20-30% (wealthy buyers)

### Profit Margin Comparison (Daggerford Farm Pig, 250 lbs)

**Scenario 1: All Fresh (Sold in Uktar - Fall Glut)**
```
Revenue:
- Retail cuts: 97 lbs @ 1.8 sp/lb (fall prices -10%) = 174.6 sp
- Lard: 25 lbs @ 4 sp/lb = 100 sp
- Byproducts: 19 sp
TOTAL: 293.6 sp

Costs:
- Raising: 180 sp
- Processing: 40 sp
TOTAL: 220 sp

PROFIT: 73.6 sp (33% ROI)
Timeline: 7 months raising + 2 days processing
```

**Scenario 2: Strategic Preservation (Cure in Uktar, Sell in Alturiak - Winter Premium)**
```
Revenue:
PRESERVED:
- Bacon: 7 lbs @ 4.6 sp/lb (winter +15%) = 32.2 sp
- Country ham: 30 lbs @ 5.8 sp/lb (winter +15%) = 174 sp
- Smoked sausage: 20 lbs @ 2.9 sp/lb (winter +15%) = 58 sp

FRESH (sold in Uktar before curing):
- Chops/tenderloin: 40 lbs @ 1.8 sp/lb = 72 sp

BYPRODUCTS:
- Lard: 25 lbs @ 5 sp/lb (winter +25%) = 125 sp
- Other: 19 sp

TOTAL: 480.2 sp

Costs:
- Raising: 180 sp
- Processing: 50 sp (extra labor for curing)
- Cure/smoke materials: 8 sp
- Storage (4 months): 10 sp
TOTAL: 248 sp

PROFIT: 232.2 sp (94% ROI)
Timeline: 7 months raising + 6 weeks curing + 2-4 months storage
```

**Preservation Advantage: +158.6 sp (+215% increase) IF you can wait 4-6 months and have storage.**

### The Break-Even Analysis

**When Does Preservation Pay Off?**

**Required Conditions:**
1. **Storage cost < 15 sp** (root cellar or cool space available)
2. **Can wait 2-6 months** for winter pricing (cash flow allows delay)
3. **Winter premium ≥ 15%** (market scarcity in cold months)
4. **Vertical integration** (raising own pigs OR buying wholesale)

**If ANY of these fail, sell fresh** (preservation loses money).

### Labor Cost Reality Check

**Processing Time by Product:**

| Product | Time (per pig) | Labor Cost @ 2 sp/hour |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Fresh cuts only** | 10 hours | 20 sp |
| **+ Bacon** | +6 hours (cure/smoke) | +12 sp = 32 sp |
| **+ Country ham** | +8 hours (cure/smoke) | +16 sp = 48 sp |
| **+ Sausage** | +4 hours (grind/stuff/smoke) | +8 sp = 56 sp |
| **+ Lard rendering** | +6 hours | +12 sp = 68 sp |
| **FULL PRESERVATION** | 34 hours | 68 sp |

**This is why small butchers specialize:**
- Some focus on fresh cuts (fast turnover, low labor)
- Some focus on bacon/ham (premium products, higher margin)
- Some focus on sausage (uses trim, volume sales)

**Vertical integration is ESSENTIAL** for full preservation to be profitable (otherwise labor costs consume margin).

---

## CONCLUSION: The Preservation Imperative

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Pork ≠ Beef:** Preservation is MANDATORY for profitability (not optional)

2. **The Big Three:**
   - **Bacon:** 100-400% value increase (belly worth 4-8x more cured)
   - **Ham:** 150-750% value increase (long-cure commands premium)
   - **Lard:** 20-25x more valuable than beef tallow (4-5 sp/lb)

3. **Vertical Integration Required:**
   - Can't buy retail pork and cure profitably
   - Must raise own pigs OR buy wholesale (50-60% of retail live prices)
   - Small-town butchers = farmer-butchers (not separate trades)

4. **Seasonal Timing is CRITICAL:**
   - **Fall slaughter** (Uktar) = traditional, optimal
   - **Winter sales** (Hammer/Alturiak) = +15-25% pricing premium
   - Cure in fall → sell in winter → **capture scarcity premium**

5. **Labor is the Hidden Cost:**
   - Full preservation = 34 hours per pig (vs 10 hours fresh-only)
   - Must charge premium prices to justify time investment
   - Specialization is key (focus on 1-2 products, not all)

6. **Storage is Non-Negotiable:**
   - Root cellar (40-55°F) minimum
   - Smokehouse for bacon/ham/sausage
   - Aging room for long-cure products (climate-controlled)
   - **No storage = no preservation** (physically impossible)

7. **Know Your Market:**
   - Northern regions: lard, bacon, sausage (survival foods)
   - Southern regions: fresh > preserved (hot climate, scarcity)
   - Urban centers: volume sausage, commercial bacon
   - Rural: long-cure hams, artisan products

**Final Word:**

*If you're raising pigs in Faerûn and NOT preserving at least 40% of each animal, you're leaving 100-200 silver pieces on the table per pig. Preservation isn't a nice-to-have—it's the entire economic model that makes pork viable.*
