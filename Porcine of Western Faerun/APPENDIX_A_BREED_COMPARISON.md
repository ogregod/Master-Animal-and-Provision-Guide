## ECONOMIC COMPARISON (FRESH vs PRESERVED)

### **Fresh Sale Value (No Preservation)**

| Breed | Purchase Cost | Fresh Retail Value | Net Profit | ROI |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|------------|-----|
| **Daggerford Farm** | 700-800 sp | 360 sp | -380 to -440 sp | **LOSS** |
| **Waterdeep Common** | 700-784 sp | 357 sp | -387 to -427 sp | **LOSS** |
| **Goldenfields Heritage** | 1,350-1,890 sp | 500 sp | -850 to -1,390 sp | **MASSIVE LOSS** |
| **Cormyrean Black** | 3,600-5,400 sp | 685 sp | -2,915 to -4,715 sp | **CATASTROPHIC** |
| **Neverwinter Northern** | 822-1,058 sp | 356 sp | -466 to -702 sp | **LOSS** |
| **Trielta Forest** | 1,320-1,980 sp | 346 sp | -974 to -1,634 sp | **MASSIVE LOSS** |
| **Calishite Bristleback** | 1,600-2,400 sp | 271 sp | -1,329 to -2,129 sp | **CATASTROPHIC** |
| **Western Wild Boar** | Hunt (75-85 sp) | 294 sp | +209 to +219 sp | **PROFIT** |

**Critical Insight:** EVERY domesticated breed LOSES MONEY if sold fresh without preservation. Only Wild Boar (hunted, not purchased) is profitable fresh.

**This is why preservation is MANDATORY for pork economics.**

---

### **Preserved Sale Value (Strategic Preservation)**

| Breed | Purchase | Preservation Strategy | Preserved Value | Net Profit |
|-------|----------|----------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Daggerford Farm** | 750 sp | Balanced (bacon, ham, sausage) | 438 sp | **-312 sp** ❌ |
| **Waterdeep Common** | 742 sp | Sausage focus (60% ground) | 377 sp | **-365 sp** ❌ |
| **Goldenfields Heritage** | 1,620 sp | Bacon specialty (branded) | 611 sp | **-1,009 sp** ❌ |
| **Cormyrean Black** | 4,500 sp | 12-month aged ham | 978 sp | **-3,522 sp** ❌ |
| **Neverwinter Northern** | 940 sp | Lard + smoked ham | 382 sp | **-558 sp** ❌ |
| **Trielta Forest** | 1,650 sp | 9-month aged ham | 466 sp | **-1,184 sp** ❌ |
| **Calishite Bristleback** | 2,000 sp | Spice-cured (heavy spice) | 343 sp | **-1,657 sp** ❌ |
| **Western Wild Boar** | 85 sp | Smoked + trophies | 294 sp | **+209 sp** ✅ |

**WAIT - Why Are All Showing Losses?**

**The Missing Piece: RETAIL MARKUP**

These are **wholesale/production** costs vs **wholesale** revenue. Butchers then sell at **retail markup** (50-100%+):

**Corrected Model (With Retail Markup):**

| Breed | Cost | Wholesale Value | Retail Markup | Retail Revenue | Actual Profit |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Daggerford Farm** | 750 sp | 438 sp | 50% | 657 sp | **-93 sp** ❌ |
| **Goldenfields Heritage** | 1,620 sp | 611 sp | 100% | 1,222 sp | **-398 sp** ❌ |
| **Cormyrean Black** | 4,500 sp | 978 sp | 150% | 2,445 sp | **-2,055 sp** ❌ |

**STILL LOSSES!? What's happening?**

**The ACTUAL Model (Integrated Operations):**

Butchers don't buy pigs at retail live prices - they either:
1. **Raise own pigs** (capture farmer profit margin)
2. **Buy wholesale from farmers** (50-70% of live retail price)

**Example: Daggerford Farm (Integrated Butcher-Farmer):**
```
Raising cost (farm): 180-220 sp (feed, housing, labor)
Processing + preservation: 50 sp
Total cost: 230-270 sp

Retail revenue (preserved): 657 sp
ACTUAL PROFIT: 387-427 sp ✅ SUCCESS
```

**This is why vertical integration is CRITICAL for pork economics.**
