# UNIVERSAL PORCINE ANATOMY & CUTS
## Essential Knowledge for All Swine Processing

*Every pig - from common farm hogs to dangerous wild boar - shares the same basic anatomy. Nine primal cuts, consistent skeletal structure, predictable muscle groups. Learn this once, apply it to every breed you encounter. The specifics vary, but the foundation remains constant.*

## FOUNDATION INTEGRATION

From **Master Butcher's Guide § Animal Classification & Anatomy, Porcine Family:**

**Universal Porcine Yields (250 lb baseline):**
- **Retail Cuts:** 55% dressed weight (97 lbs from 250 lb pig)
- **Lard:** 10-12% live weight (25-30 lbs) - HIGHLY VALUABLE
- **Bones:** 10% dressed (18 lbs) - stock, soup bones
- **Hide:** 6% live weight (15 lbs) - less valuable than cattle
- **Organs:** 3% live weight (8 lbs) - heart, liver, kidneys
- **Waste/Loss:** 16% - intestinal contents, blood, processing loss

**Key Differences from Cattle:**
- **Higher dressing %:** 70-75% (vs 60-62% beef)
- **Higher efficiency:** 38.8% live to retail (vs 23% beef)
- **NO aging required:** Fresh pork immediately usable
- **Faster processing:** 8-12 hours (vs 12-18 hours beef)
- **Valuable fat:** Lard 4-5 sp/lb (vs tallow 0.2 sp/lb)

**Processing Timeline:**
- Slaughter to hang: 1-2 hours
- Chilling: 12-24 hours at 34-38°F (NO aging, just cooling)
- Primal breakdown: 1-2 hours
- Retail fabrication: 4-7 hours
- **Total active labor:** 8-12 hours

## THE NINE PRIMAL CUTS

Primals are the major sections created during initial breakdown. Each contains multiple retail cuts and has specific preservation applications.

### **PRIMAL PERCENTAGES & PRIMARY USES**

| Primal | % of Carcass | Tenderness | Primary Cuts | Fresh Use | Preservation Use |
|--------|--------------|------------|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Boston Butt** | 8% | Moderate | Steaks, Roasts | Roasts, Kabobs | **SAUSAGE** (ideal fat ratio) |
| **Picnic Shoulder** | 8% | Tough | Roasts, Hocks | Roasts, Ground | Smoked Shoulder, Ham |
| **Loin** | 18% | Very Tender | Chops, Tenderloin | **Fresh Premium** | Cured Loin (Canadian Bacon) |
| **Belly** | 12% | Fatty | Fresh Pork Belly | Pork Belly | **BACON** (primary use) |
| **Ham** | 20% | Moderate | Fresh Ham, Steaks | Fresh Ham Roasts | **CURED HAM** (premium) |
| **Jowl** | 3% | Fatty | Jowl Bacon | Fresh use rare | **Guanciale** (specialty cure) |

| **Feet (Trotters)** | 4% | Gelatinous | Trotters | Braised | Pickled Trotters |
| **Head** | 8% | Varied | Cheek, Snout | Braised Cheeks | Headcheese, Scrapple |

**Remaining:**
- **Lard-bearing tissue:** 10-12% live weight (internal leaf lard + back fat)
- **Hide:** 6% live weight
- **Organs:** 3% live weight
- **Waste:** 16%

## YIELD CALCULATIONS (250 LB BASELINE)

### **Live Weight to Retail Conversion**

**Standard Formula:**
```
Live Weight: 250 lbs
↓ (72% dressing percentage)
Dressed Weight (carcass): 180 lbs
↓ (2% trim loss during fabrication, NO aging)
Fabrication Weight: 177 lbs
↓ (55% retail cuts from dressed weight)
Retail Cuts: 97 lbs

Live to Retail Yield: 38.8% (97 ÷ 250)
```

**Complete Breakdown (250 lb pig):**
```
RETAIL CUTS: 97 lbs (38.8%)
+ Lard: 25 lbs (10%) @ 4 sp/lb = 100 sp
+ Hide: 15 lbs (6%) @ 1 sp/lb = 15 sp
+ Organs: 8 lbs (3%) @ various prices = 4 sp
+ Bones: 18 lbs (7%) @ 0.2-0.3 sp/lb = 4 sp
---
USABLE PRODUCTS: 163 lbs (65.2%)
WASTE: 87 lbs (34.8%)
```

**Why Higher Efficiency than Cattle:**
- Less bone mass relative to meat
- More compact body structure
- Valuable fat (lard) vs waste fat (tallow)
- No aging shrinkage

## PRIMAL BREAKDOWN - DETAILED

### **1. BOSTON BUTT (Shoulder Top)**

**Percentage:** 8% of dressed weight = ~14 lbs from 250 lb pig

**Location:** Upper shoulder (despite name "butt" = shoulder region)

**Characteristics:**
- Excellent marbling (intramuscular fat)
- Perfect fat-to-lean ratio for sausage (30% fat / 70% lean)
- Moderate tenderness (needs cooking)

**Fresh Retail Cuts:**
- **2 Pork Shoulder Steaks** (1.5 lbs each) @ 2.2 sp/lb
- **1 Boston Butt Roast** (3-4 lbs) @ 2.5 sp/lb

**Preservation Use:**
- **SAUSAGE PRODUCTION** (primary use - 80% of Boston Butt)
- Ground and seasoned (30/70 fat ratio = perfect)
- Fresh sausage, smoked sausage, cured sausage

**Value Comparison:**
- Fresh: 14 lbs @ 2.2 sp/lb avg = 31 sp
- Sausage: 12 lbs @ 2.5-3 sp/lb = 30-36 sp (plus value-add)

---

### **2. PICNIC SHOULDER (Shoulder Lower)**

**Percentage:** 8% of dressed weight = ~14 lbs from 250 lb pig

**Location:** Lower shoulder, includes front leg

**Characteristics:**
- More connective tissue than Boston Butt
- Includes skin, bone, hock
- Excellent for slow cooking

**Fresh Retail Cuts:**
- **1 Picnic Roast** (bone-in, 8-10 lbs) @ 1.8 sp/lb
- **2 Pork Hocks** (front, 2 lbs each) @ 1.5 sp each

**Preservation Use:**
- **Smoked Shoulder** (whole picnic smoked)
- **Cured and smoked hocks** (German/Central European tradition)
- **Ground for sausage** (if boned out)

**Value Comparison:**
- Fresh: 14 lbs @ 1.8 sp/lb avg = 25 sp
- Smoked: 10 lbs @ 3-4 sp/lb = 30-40 sp (20-60% value increase)

---

### **3. LOIN (Premium Fresh Pork)**

**Percentage:** 18% of dressed weight = ~32 lbs from 250 lb pig

**Location:** Back, runs from shoulder to hip

**Characteristics:**
- **MOST TENDER** primal in pig
- Minimal marbling (lean)
- Premium fresh pork source

**Contains:**
- **Tenderloin:** 2-3 lbs total (2 tenderloins, 1-1.5 lbs each)
- **Loin muscle:** 20-24 lbs (for chops, roasts)
- **Back ribs (baby back):** 4-5 lbs

**Fresh Retail Cuts (CHOOSE ONE OPTION):**

**Option A - Bone-In Chops (Traditional):**
- **18-22 Pork Chops** (bone-in, 12-14 oz each) @ 2.5 sp each
- **2 Pork Tenderloins** (1-1.5 lbs each) @ 4 sp each
- **1 Rack Baby Back Ribs** (4-5 lbs) @ 3 sp/lb

**Option B - Boneless Premium (Higher Total Value):**
- **24-28 Boneless Pork Chops** (8-10 oz each) @ 2.2 sp each
- **2 Pork Tenderloins** (1-1.5 lbs each) @ 4 sp each
- **1 Rack Baby Back Ribs** (4-5 lbs, separated) @ 3 sp/lb
- **2 Boneless Loin Roasts** (3-4 lbs each) @ 2.8 sp each

**Preservation Use (RARE - typically fresh):**
- **Canadian Bacon** (cured, smoked loin - specialty)
- Most loin sold fresh (premium lean cuts)

**Value:**
- Fresh: 32 lbs @ 2.5-3 sp/lb avg = 80-96 sp
- Loin is THE premium fresh pork primal

---

### **4. BELLY (BACON PRIMAL)**

**Percentage:** 12% of dressed weight = ~22 lbs from 250 lb pig

**Location:** Underside, from front legs to hind legs

**Characteristics:**
- **Layered fat and meat** (distinctive streaking)
- High fat content (50-60% fat, 40-50% meat)
- **PRIMARY BACON SOURCE**

**Fresh Retail Cuts (Uncommon):**
- **Fresh Pork Belly** (whole or half, 20-22 lbs) @ 2 sp/lb
- Rarely sold fresh (preservation value too high)

**Preservation Use (PRIMARY):**
- **BACON PRODUCTION** (80-90% of all belly)
- Cured, smoked, sliced
- Yield: 22 lbs fresh → 16-18 lbs cured bacon (shrinkage from moisture loss)

**Value Comparison:**
- Fresh belly: 22 lbs @ 2 sp/lb = 44 sp
- Cured bacon: 17 lbs @ 4-6 sp/lb = 68-102 sp (**54-132% value increase!**)

**Why Bacon Matters:**
The belly primal represents THE SINGLE BIGGEST PRESERVATION VALUE-ADD in pork processing. Converting 22 lbs of $2/lb belly into 17 lbs of $4-6/lb bacon adds 50-130% profit. This is why premium breeds focus on belly quality.

---

### **5. HAM (Largest Primal)**

**Percentage:** 20% of dressed weight = ~36 lbs from 250 lb pig

**Location:** Hind leg (one per side, 18 lbs each)

**Characteristics:**
- Largest single primal cut
- Lean muscle groups (minimal marbling)
- Excellent for curing (low fat content)

**Fresh Retail Cuts:**
- **2 Fresh Ham Roasts** (bone-in, 16-18 lbs each) @ 2.2 sp/lb
- **4-6 Ham Steaks** (cut from center, 1-1.5 lbs each) @ 2.5 sp each
- **2 Hocks** (rear, 2-3 lbs each) @ 1.5 sp each

**Preservation Use (PRIMARY - 70% of ham):**

**Short-Cure Smoked Ham (1-2 weeks):**
- City/commercial style
- 18 lbs fresh → 15 lbs cured @ 5-6 sp/lb = 75-90 sp
- Standard preservation

**Long-Cure Aged Ham (3-12 months):**
- Country/estate style (prosciutto, Serrano, etc.)
- 18 lbs fresh → 12-14 lbs aged @ 8-12 sp/lb = 96-168 sp
- Premium luxury product
- Requires controlled environment (time + skill investment)

**Value Comparison (per ham):**
- Fresh: 18 lbs @ 2.2 sp/lb = 40 sp
- Short-cure: 15 lbs @ 5-6 sp/lb = 75-90 sp (88-125% increase)
- Long-cure: 13 lbs @ 10-12 sp/lb = 130-156 sp (225-290% increase!)

**Why Premium Breeds Focus on Ham:**
Long-cure aged ham represents the HIGHEST value-add in pork processing (225-290% increase). Cormyrean Black and Trielta Forest pigs command premiums specifically for ham curing potential.

---

**Location:** Rib cage (below baby back ribs, connects to belly)

**Characteristics:**
- More fat than baby back ribs
- Bone-in cuts (50% bone, 50% meat)
- Excellent for smoking

**Fresh Retail Cuts:**
- **1 Rack Spareribs** (full rack, 4-5 lbs) @ 2.5 sp/lb
- **St. Louis Style Ribs** (trimmed, 3-4 lbs) @ 3 sp/lb

**Preservation Use:**

**Value:**
- Fresh: 9 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb avg = 22.5 sp
- Typically sold fresh (customer preference for home smoking)

---

### **8. FEET (TROTTERS)**

**Percentage:** 4% of dressed weight = ~7 lbs from 250 lb pig

**Location:** All four feet

**Characteristics:**
- High collagen/gelatin content
- Minimal meat
- Specialty/ethnic markets

**Fresh Retail Cuts:**
- **4 Pork Trotters** (whole feet, ~1.75 lbs each) @ 0.8 sp each

**Preservation Use:**
- **Pickled Trotters** (vinegar brine)
- Specialty preservation

**Value:**
- Fresh: 7 lbs @ 0.5 sp/lb avg = 3.5 sp
- Limited market (ethnic/specialty demand)

---

### **9. HEAD**

**Percentage:** 8% of dressed weight = ~14 lbs from 250 lb pig

**Location:** Entire head (skull, cheeks, snout, ears, brain)

**Characteristics:**
- Varied tissues (meat, fat, bone, cartilage)
- Requires skilled processing
- Specialty products

**Fresh Retail Cuts:**
- **Pork Cheeks** (2 cheeks, 1 lb total) @ 3 sp/lb
- **Whole Head** (if sold, rare, 14 lbs) @ 0.5 sp/lb

**Preservation Use:**
- **Headcheese** (terrine from head meat, 6-8 lbs yield) @ 2 sp/lb
- **Scrapple** (ground head meat + cornmeal, 8-10 lbs) @ 1.5 sp/lb

**Value Comparison:**
- Fresh: 14 lbs @ 0.5 sp/lb avg = 7 sp
- Headcheese: 7 lbs @ 2 sp/lb = 14 sp (100% increase)

**Market Reality:**
Head products are ethnic/regional specialties. Urban markets (Waterdeep) have demand. Rural areas may waste heads (limited knowledge/equipment).

---

## BYPRODUCTS - CRITICAL VALUE

### **LARD (Premium Fat Product)**

**Yield:** 10-12% of live weight = 25-30 lbs from 250 lb pig

**Sources:**
- **Leaf Lard (internal, kidney fat):** 8-10 lbs (HIGHEST QUALITY, snow-white, neutral flavor)
- **Back Fat (external):** 12-15 lbs (good quality, slight pork flavor)
- **Trim Fat (various):** 3-5 lbs (lower quality, rendering mix)

**Processing:**
1. Separate fat by quality grade
2. Render (heat to melt fat, strain solids)
3. Cool and package
4. Yield: ~25 lbs raw fat → 22-23 lbs rendered lard (10% loss to cracklins)

**Pricing:**
- **Premium Leaf Lard:** 5-6 sp/lb (baking, pastry - prized)
- **Standard Lard:** 4-5 sp/lb (cooking, frying)
- **Cracklins (byproduct):** 1.5 sp/lb (fried fat solids, snack)

**Total Lard Value (250 lb pig):**
- 8 lbs leaf lard @ 5.5 sp/lb = 44 sp
- 15 lbs standard lard @ 4.5 sp/lb = 67.5 sp
- 2 lbs cracklins @ 1.5 sp/lb = 3 sp
- **TOTAL: 114.5 sp from lard alone**

**Why Lard Matters:**
Lard value (114.5 sp) can equal or exceed meat value from the same pig. In cold climates (Neverwinter), lard is MORE valuable than meat due to winter survival uses (cooking, heating, light, soap).

**Lard vs Tallow (Beef):**
- **Lard:** 4-5 sp/lb (neutral flavor, high smoke point, baking quality)
- **Tallow:** 0.2 sp/lb (strong flavor, limited culinary use)
- **Lard is 20-25x more valuable per pound**

---

### **HIDE**

**Yield:** 6% of live weight = 15 lbs from 250 lb pig

**Characteristics:**
- Thinner than cattle hide
- Hair must be removed (scalding + scraping OR skinning)
- Less durable leather

**Processing Options:**

**Option A - Scalding (Hair Removal, Skin On):**
- Skin scored and sold with primal cuts
- Adds texture/flavor to roasts
- Crackling (roasted skin) specialty
- No separate hide value (integrated with cuts)

**Option B - Skinning (Leather Production):**
- Hide removed intact
- Sold to tanner
- 15 lbs @ 1 sp/lb = 15 sp
- Thin leather (gloves, small goods, not heavy leather)

**Most Common:** Scalding (skin-on cuts preferred for flavor/texture)

---

### **ORGANS**

**Yield:** 3% of live weight = 8 lbs from 250 lb pig

**Individual Organs:**

**Heart:**
- 1 heart @ ~0.75 lbs
- Price: 1.5 sp
