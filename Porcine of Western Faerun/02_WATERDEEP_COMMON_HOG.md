# WATERDEEP COMMON HOG
## Urban Commercial Pork Production

*Waterdeep's million people need meat. Waterdeep Common Hogs turn city waste into pork - fed on brewery spent grain, kitchen scraps, market refuse. They're not prestigious, they're not premium, but they're efficient, productive, and they keep a city fed. Urban commercial pork at scale. This is how you feed a metropolis.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## QUICK STATS

**Primary Purpose:** Urban Commercial Pork (high-volume production)

**Secondary Purpose:** Sausage production, waste conversion

**Origin:** Waterdeep (urban selective breeding for waste-fed efficiency)

**Availability:** Common in major cities, rare in rural areas

**Climate Adaptation:** Urban environment (tolerates confinement, crowding, waste diet)

**Typical Operation Size:** 100-300 head (large urban commercial operations)

**Market Position:** Volume/Commercial - "Working class pork"

**Slaughter Age:** 8 months at optimal weight (fast growth on waste feed)

---

## PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### **Size & Weight**

**Processing Standard:** 280 lb hog at 8 months

**Live Weight by Management:**
- **Optimal Commercial** (waste-fed, 8 months): 270-290 lbs
- **Rapid Growth** (heavy waste feed, 7 months): 250-270 lbs (rushed, lower quality)
- **Extended** (9-10 months): 300-320 lbs (diminishing returns, excess fat)

**Growth Rate:** ~1.15 lbs/day (faster than baseline due to unlimited waste feed access)

**Key Difference from Baseline:** +30 lbs heavier (urban waste = unlimited calories), but **lower meat quality** (waste diet affects flavor, more fat, less muscle).

**Urban Growth Advantage:**
Waste-fed pigs have constant food access:
- Brewery spent grain (carbohydrate-rich, fattening)
- Kitchen scraps (variable nutrients, high calorie)
- Market refuse (vegetables, bread waste, spoiled goods)
- **Result:** Rapid growth, heavy fattening, but less controlled meat quality

### **Appearance**

**Color:**
- White/pink skin (60% - commercial standard)
- Black and white spotted (25%)
- Solid black (10%)
- Red/brown (5%)

**Build:**
- **Stocky, heavy body** (fat accumulation from waste diet)
- **Short legs** (confinement breeding - doesn't need to walk far)
- **Broad back** (commercial breeding for meat volume)
- **Heavy jowls** (fat storage, visible fattening)

**Distinctive Features:**
- Visibly fat (rounded body shape - waste-fed = calories exceed needs)
- Short, compact frame (urban confinement adaptation)
- Calm demeanor (bred for crowded conditions, minimal stress)
- Clean appearance (commercial operations = regular washing, management)

**Height:** 28-32 inches at shoulder (similar to baseline, but heavier/stockier)

### **Temperament**

**Disposition:** Very docile, tolerant of crowding

- Urban-raised (comfortable in confined spaces)
- Group-tolerant (100+ pigs in facility, minimal aggression)
- Human-acclimated (daily human contact, feeding)
- Low-stress (bred for commercial handling, processing)

**Processing Note:** Easiest pigs to handle (docile, predictable behavior). Commercial operations process dozens per day - temperament critical for worker safety and efficiency.

## YIELDS & PROCESSING

### **Processing Yields (280 lb hog)**

**Breakdown:**
```
Live Weight: 280 lbs
↓ (73% dressing - good body condition despite waste diet)
Dressed Weight: 204 lbs
↓ (2% trim loss)
Fabrication Weight: 200 lbs
↓ (54% retail cuts - slightly lower proportion due to excess fat)
Retail Cuts: 108 lbs

Total Retail Yield: 38.6% live to retail (+0.2% over baseline)
```

**Complete Breakdown:**
```
RETAIL CUTS: 108 lbs (38.6%)
- Premium (loin, tenderloin): 32 lbs
- Choice (shoulder, ham fresh): 32 lbs
- Standard (belly, ribs): 32 lbs
- Utility (ground, trim): 12 lbs (MORE TRIM - excess fat trimmed)

BYPRODUCTS:
+ Lard: 30 lbs (10.7% live weight - high due to waste-fed fattening) @ 3.5-4 sp/lb = 105-120 sp
+ Hide: 17 lbs (6%) @ 0.8 sp/lb = 13.6 sp
+ Organs: 9 lbs (3.2%) @ various = 4.5 sp
+ Bones: 20 lbs (7.1%) @ 0.2 sp/lb = 4 sp

USABLE PRODUCTS: 184 lbs (65.7%)
WASTE: 96 lbs (34.3%)
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Heavier overall** (waste-fed = more calories = more weight)
- **More fat** (30 lbs lard vs 25 lbs baseline = +20% lard)
- **More trim waste** (excess fat trimmed from retail cuts)
- **Flavor variation** (waste diet = less consistent flavor vs controlled grain/pasture diets)

**Waste Diet Impact on Flavor:**
- **Brewery-heavy diet:** Slight yeasty/grain notes (not unpleasant, just different)
- **Kitchen scrap diet:** Variable (depends on urban cuisine - spices, variety)
- **Market refuse diet:** Generally neutral (vegetables, bread = mild impact)
- **Quality control:** Commercial operations manage diet (avoid strong-flavored waste that affects meat)

### **Primal Distribution (Compared to Baseline)**

- **Loin:** 17% → ~35 lbs retail (slightly larger, more fat cover)
- **Ham:** 20% → ~41 lbs retail (standard proportion)
- **Belly:** 13% → ~27 lbs retail (+1% - excess fat accumulation)
- **Boston Butt:** 8% → ~16 lbs retail (standard)
- **Picnic Shoulder:** 8% → ~16 lbs retail (standard)
- **Spareribs:** 5% → ~10 lbs retail (standard)
- **Head:** 7% → ~14 lbs (standard)
- **Jowl:** 3% → ~6 lbs (standard)
- **Feet:** 4% → ~8 lbs (standard)

**Commercial Breeding Focus:**
Waterdeep Common Hog bred for:
1. **Volume:** Larger size = more meat per pig
2. **Feed efficiency:** Convert waste to meat rapidly
3. **Docility:** Safe handling in high-volume operations
4. **NOT flavor:** Quality secondary to quantity (working-class market doesn't demand premium)

### **Processing Time**

**Total Active Labor:** 11 hours average

**Timeline:**
- Initial processing: 1.5-2 hours (larger animal, commercial speed)
- Chilling: 18-24 hours at 34-38°F
- Primal breakdown: 1.5-2 hours
- Retail fabrication: 6-7 hours (more fat trim = slightly longer)

**Labor Cost:** ~44 sp (11 hours × 4 sp/hour journeyman rate)

**Commercial Processing Efficiency:**
Large urban operations process 20-50 pigs/day:
- Assembly line methods (specialization, each worker one task)
- Economies of scale (labor cost per pig drops to ~25-30 sp in volume)
- Speed prioritized (quality sufficient for market, not premium standards)

- Net value (bulk): 329 sp per pig
- **Volume:** 100 pigs/week = 32,900 sp revenue/week

---

## SAUSAGE PRODUCTION (PRIMARY COMMERCIAL FOCUS)

### **Urban Sausage Economics**

**Why Sausage Dominates Urban Pork:**

1. **Fast turnover:** Fresh sausage sells daily (no curing wait time)
2. **Consistent demand:** Working-class staple (breakfast, dinner, street food)
3. **Uses all trim:** Every part of pig → sausage (maximum utilization)
4. **Price point:** Affordable (1.8-2.2 sp/lb vs 3-5 sp/lb premium cuts)
5. **Shelf life:** Fresh sausage (3-5 days) acceptable for urban daily market

**Commercial Sausage Production (From One 280 lb Hog):**

**Sausage Allocation:**
- Belly: 23 lbs (often ground instead of cured as bacon)
- Boston Butt: 16 lbs
- Trim/fat: 12 lbs
- **Total:** 51 lbs meat → sausage

**Yields:**
- 51 lbs meat (already ~30% fat) → 48 lbs fresh sausage (6% loss to moisture, trimming)

**Packaging:**
- 48 packages (1 lb links, 4 links/package)
- OR 96 packages (8 oz links, 4 links/package)

**Value:**
- Fresh meat value: 51 lbs @ 1.8 sp/lb avg = 91.8 sp
- **Fresh sausage:** 48 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb = 120 sp
- **VALUE INCREASE: +31%** (28.2 sp profit)

**But the REAL Advantage:**
- Sausage sells **same day** (no inventory holding)
- Fresh cuts sit **3-7 days** (inventory cost, spoilage risk)
- **Turnover:** Sausage = daily cash flow vs weekly for fresh cuts

**Urban Sausage Varieties (Waterdeep):**

**Dock Ward Breakfast Links:**
- Heavy sage, black pepper (working-class taste)
- 8 oz packages (affordable portion)
- Price: 1.8-2 sp/package

**Trades Ward Italian:**
- Fennel, garlic, red pepper flakes (ethnic tradition)
- 1 lb packages (family size)
- Price: 2.5-3 sp/package

**Castle Ward Gourmet:**
- Apple, sage, white wine (upscale market)
- 12 oz packages (premium portion)
- Price: 3.5-4 sp/package

---

## BACON PRODUCTION (Secondary Product)

**Commercial Bacon (If Belly NOT Used for Sausage):**

**Process:** Standard cure + smoke

**Yields:**
- 23 lbs fresh belly → 17 lbs cured bacon

**Value:**
- Fresh belly: 23 lbs @ 1.8 sp/lb = 41.4 sp
- **Commercial bacon:** 17 lbs @ 3.5 sp/lb = 59.5 sp
- **VALUE INCREASE: +44%** (18.1 sp profit)

**Commercial Decision:**
- **Bacon:** Higher profit margin (+44%), but 2-week cure time (inventory hold)
- **Sausage (belly ground):** Lower profit (+31%), but same-day turnover

**Result:** Most urban operations do 60-70% sausage, 30-40% bacon (balance profit vs turnover).

- Faster turnover = better cash flow (critical for urban operations)
- Consistent product (sausage quality predictable, fresh cuts variable)

---

## PURCHASE PRICING

**Live Animal Costs (Waterdeep, 1492 DR):**

**Commercial Rate:** 2.5-2.8 sp per pound live weight

**280 lb Common Hog:** 700-784 sp (70-78 gp)

**Why Lower than Baseline (Despite Larger Size):**

**Volume Discount:**
- Urban operations buy 50-200 pigs at once (wholesale pricing)
- -10 to -15% bulk discount vs retail single-pig pricing

**Waste-Fed (Lower Cost):**
- "Free" feed (urban waste conversion) = lower raising costs
- Farmers charge less (cheaper inputs = lower retail price)

**Commercial Quality:**
- Not premium (waste diet, confinement raising)
- Working-class market (price-sensitive, not quality-driven)

**Regional Variations:**
- **Waterdeep (origin):** Baseline (2.5-2.8 sp/lb)
- **Other cities (Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter):** Similar (urban commercial universal)
- **Rural areas:** Not available (waste-fed model requires city infrastructure)

**Seasonal Variations:**
- **Year-round consistent:** Urban operations don't follow agricultural seasons
- **Slight winter premium:** +5-10% (holiday demand, but minimal compared to rural seasonal swings)

**Volume Purchase (Commercial Operations):**
- 50-100 head: -10% (700-784 sp → 630-706 sp per pig)
- 100-200 head: -15% (700-784 sp → 595-666 sp per pig)
- **Result:** Large operations pay 595-706 sp per pig (vs 700-784 sp retail)

**Comparison to Other Breeds:**
- Waterdeep Common: 2.5-2.8 sp/lb
- Daggerford Farm: 2.8-3.2 sp/lb
- **Discount: -10 to -22%** (urban commercial vs rural standard)

**Is It Worth It?**

**For Commercial Operations: YES**
- Purchase (volume): 650 sp (avg)
- Net value (sausage focus): 377 sp retail
- **Loss: 273 sp per pig!?**

**Wait - How Do They Profit?**

**Volume Wholesale Math:**
- Sausage wholesale (not retail): 2 sp/lb (vs 2.5 sp/lb retail)
- Fresh cuts wholesale: -20% off retail
- **Wholesale value:** 310 sp
- Processing (bulk): 28 sp
- **Net wholesale:** 282 sp
- **Still losing 368 sp per pig!**

**The SECRET: Waste Feed = Nearly Free**

**Urban Pig Farmer Costs:**
- Purchase piglet: 50-80 sp (weaned, 40-60 lbs)
- Feed (waste): 10-30 sp (minimal - collection/transport only)
- Housing: 20-30 sp per pig (large facilities, amortized)
- Labor: 15-25 sp per pig (8 months care, economies of scale)
- **Total raising cost:** 95-165 sp

**Farmer sells at:** 650 sp (wholesale to butcher)
**Farmer profit:** 485-555 sp per pig

**Butcher buys at:** 650 sp
**Butcher processes/sells:** 310 sp wholesale OR 377 sp retail
**Butcher LOSS if buying wholesale, selling wholesale:** 340 sp (terrible!)

**Solution:** Butchers either:
1. **Integrate operations:** Raise AND process (capture farmer profit)
2. **Retail focus:** Buy 650 sp, sell retail 377 sp (still losing - must sell at markup)

**ACTUAL Retail Markup:**
- Butcher buys: 650 sp
- Sells retail (all products): 450-500 sp (realistic retail, not theoretical)
- **Still losing 150-200 sp per pig**

**This doesn't work unless... OH.**

**The model that WORKS:**
1. **Integrated operations:** Farmer-butcher (raise on waste, process, sell retail) = 377-400 sp revenue - 120 sp costs = 257-280 sp profit
2. **Vertical integration:** Large operations control full chain (waste collection, raising, processing, retail)

This is why urban pork is **industrial operation**, not small butcher shops buying pigs retail.

## CULTURAL NOTES

### **Urban Waste-to-Meat System**

**Waterdeep's Pig Economy:**

Waterdeep produces ~500,000 lbs waste/day:
- Brewery spent grain: 200,000 lbs/day (major pig feed source)
- Kitchen scraps: 150,000 lbs/day (restaurants, homes)
- Market refuse: 150,000 lbs/day (unsold produce, bread, spoiled goods)

**Pig Consumption Capacity:**
- One pig eats: 6-8 lbs food/day
- 10,000 pigs (Waterdeep est. population) = 60,000-80,000 lbs waste/day consumed
- **Only 12-16% of waste** → pigs (rest: composting, street cleaning, dump)

**Environmental Benefit:**
- Waste-fed pigs reduce landfill (100,000 lbs/day diverted)
- Nutrient cycling (manure → farms outside city)
- Economic efficiency (waste = free feed = cheap pork)

### **Working-Class Staple**

**Sausage as Urban Food:**

Waterdeep working class diet:
- **Breakfast:** Sausage links (8 oz, 2 sp) + bread (1 cp) + ale (2 cp) = 2.3 sp meal
- **Dinner:** Sausage stew (4 oz sausage, vegetables, bread) = 1.5-2 sp meal

**Annual pork consumption (working family):**
- 4 family members × 150 lbs pork/year = 600 lbs/year
- Cost: 600 lbs @ 2 sp/lb (sausage bulk) = 1,200 sp/year (120 gp)
- **20-30% of food budget** = pork (critical protein source)

**Without Waterdeep Common Hog:**
- Must import rural pork (Daggerford): +30-50% cost
- 1,200 sp → 1,560-1,800 sp/year
- Working families can't afford (economic crisis)

**Result:** Waterdeep Common Hog = **essential urban infrastructure**, not luxury.

### **Social Class & Use**

**Working Class (Primary Market):**
- Daily sausage consumption (breakfast, dinner)
- Bulk buying (5-10 lbs/week from local butcher)
- Price-driven (quality secondary to affordability)

**Middle Class:**
- Mix of sausage (daily) + fresh cuts (weekly roast)
- Quality preference (will pay +20% for better butcher)
- Occasional premium (Goldenfields bacon as treat)

**Upper Class:**
- Rarely eat Waterdeep Common (prefer Daggerford Farm minimum)
- Servants eat Common (kitchen staff meals)
- Social distinction (eating Common = "fallen on hard times")

**Nobility:**
- Never (unless economic collapse)
- View as "pig slop pork" (waste-fed = low status)
- Exception: Vertical integration nobles (own urban operations, profit from working-class market)

---

## BREEDING NOTES (Urban Commercial)

**Waterdeep Common Selection Criteria:**

**Feed Efficiency (PRIMARY):**
- Rapid growth on waste diet (observational - fastest-growing pigs selected)
- Fat deposition (waste diet = excess calories → breed for fat storage)
- Tolerance for variable feed quality (waste = inconsistent nutrition)

**Docility (CRITICAL):**
- Confinement tolerance (100+ pigs in facility, minimal space)
- Low aggression (prevents fighting injuries, loss)
- Human-tolerant (daily handling, processing)

**Disease Resistance (Important):**
- Urban environment = disease pressure (crowding, waste exposure)
- Survival = breeding stock (weak pigs culled immediately)

**NOT Selected For:**
- Meat quality (texture, flavor, marbling) - acceptable, not premium
- Appearance (aesthetics irrelevant - commercial product)
- Specialized traits (bacon quality, ham aging) - volume prioritized

**Breeding Program:**
Urban operations maintain **commercial lines** (genetic uniformity, predictable results). Outcross to rural breeds occasionally (hybrid vigor), but select for urban efficiency.

## PROFESSIONAL NOTES

**For Butchers:**

**When to Buy Waterdeep Common:**
- **Urban location:** Serving working-class neighborhood (price-sensitive market)
- **Volume focus:** Processing 10+ pigs/week (economies of scale)
- **Sausage specialty:** Fresh sausage primary product (fast turnover)
- **Integrated operation:** Own raising facilities (capture full margin)

**When NOT to Buy:**
- **Rural location:** Transport costs erase savings (buy local Daggerford instead)
- **Premium market:** Customers demand quality (Common won't satisfy)
- **Small-scale:** 1-2 pigs/week (volume discounts unavailable, terrible economics)

**Processing Recommendation:**
Focus on sausage (60-70% of pig). Sell fresh cuts as secondary product. Lard to commercial buyers (bakeries, restaurants, bulk).

**Economic Reality:**
Waterdeep Common Hog is **volume play**. Small operations can't compete. Either go big (integrate, process 50+/week) or buy premium breeds for niche markets.

---

**— Thadius Del Irontet**
*"Waterdeep Common isn't the pig I'd choose if I were rich. But I'm not. Neither are 95% of Waterdeep's million people. Common Hog fills bellies, keeps families fed, turns waste into protein. That's not a flaw - that's civilization working. Despise it if you want, but Waterdeep runs on Common sausage."*

---

**— Marta Ironhand, Dock Ward Butcher**
*"I process 80 pigs a week. All Waterdeep Common. Sell 4,000 pounds of sausage, 1,500 pounds of fresh cuts, 2,400 pounds of lard. Revenue: 12,000 silver/week. Profit: 2,200 silver after all costs. That's 114,000 silver/year. My grandfather started with 5 silver and a borrowed cleaver. Waterdeep Common built this shop, fed my family for three generations, and put my daughter through wizard academy. Tell me again how it's 'inferior pork.'"*
