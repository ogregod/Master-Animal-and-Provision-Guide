# GOLDENFIELDS HERITAGE PIG
## Premium Grain-Fed Bacon Production

*When someone says "best bacon in Western Faerûn," they mean Goldenfields Heritage. Grain-finished on temple farms, these pigs produce thick, perfectly-marbled bellies that cure into exceptional bacon. The belly alone from a Goldenfields pig is worth what some common pigs sell for whole. Premium product, premium price, premium results.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

**Secondary Purpose:** High-quality fresh pork, aged ham

**Origin:** Goldenfields Temple Farms (Chauntea worship center)

**Availability:** Uncommon - Limited production, exported to Waterdeep/major cities

**Climate Adaptation:** Temperate (requires abundant grain surplus)

---

## PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### **Size & Weight**

**Processing Standard:** 270 lb pig at 9 months

**Live Weight by Development:**
- **Standard Finishing** (7-8 months): 240-260 lbs (not optimal)
- **Optimal Finishing** (9 months): 260-280 lbs (GRAIN-FED PEAK)
- **Extended Finishing** (10-11 months): 290-320 lbs (excess fat, diminishing returns)

**Growth Rate:** ~1.1 lbs/day (slightly faster than common breeds due to grain diet)

**Key Difference from Baseline:** +20 lbs at optimal slaughter (+8% heavier), specifically in belly and back fat development.

### **Appearance**

**Color:**
- White/pink skin with black spots (60% - traditional)
- Solid white (30%)
- Red/brown with white patches (10%)

**Build:**
- **Longer body** than Daggerford Farm Pig (+10-15% length)
- **Deeper through chest and belly** (visible depth)
- Moderate frame (not heavy-boned)
- Distinct belly development (hangs lower, visible from side)

**Distinctive Features:**
- Prominent jowls (grain-fed fattening)
- Well-developed belly (bacon primal)
- Upright ears (alert, active)
- Smooth, clean skin

**Height:** 30-34 inches at shoulder

### **Temperament**

**Disposition:** Very docile, calm

- Temple-raised (well-socialized, handled daily)
- Food-motivated (grain-fed tradition)
- Minimal stress (better marbling development)
- Comfortable with humans (processing ease)

**Breeding Selection:** Goldenfields selects for temperament as much as bacon quality. Aggressive or nervous pigs culled from breeding program.

## YIELDS & PROCESSING

### **Processing Yields (270 lb pig)**

**Breakdown:**
```
Live Weight: 270 lbs
↓ (73% dressing - slightly higher due to grain finishing)
Dressed Weight: 197 lbs
↓ (2% trim loss)
Fabrication Weight: 193 lbs
↓ (56% retail cuts - slightly higher proportion)
Retail Cuts: 108 lbs

Total Retail Yield: 40% live to retail (+1.2% over baseline)
```

**Complete Breakdown:**
```
RETAIL CUTS: 108 lbs (40%)
- Premium (loin, tenderloin): 35 lbs
- Choice (shoulder, ham fresh): 31 lbs
- Standard (belly, ribs): 36 lbs ⭐ (BACON PRIMAL LARGER)
- Utility (ground, trim): 6 lbs

BYPRODUCTS:
+ Lard: 30 lbs (11% live weight - more fat) @ 4.5-5 sp/lb = 135-150 sp
+ Hide: 16 lbs (6%) @ 1 sp/lb = 16 sp
+ Organs: 9 lbs (3.3%) @ various = 5.5 sp
+ Bones: 20 lbs (7.4%) @ 0.3 sp/lb = 6 sp

USABLE PRODUCTS: 183 lbs (67.8%)
WASTE: 87 lbs (32.2%)
```

**Key Improvements over Baseline:**
- +1.2% retail yield (better muscling + grain finishing)
- +2 lbs belly (14% vs 12% - **BACON SPECIALTY**)
- +5 lbs lard (11% vs 10% - grain fattening)
- +20% total lard value (grain finishing = premium white lard)

### **Primal Distribution (Compared to Baseline)**

- **Loin:** 18% → ~35 lbs retail (standard proportion)
- **Ham:** 20% → ~39 lbs retail (standard)
- **Belly:** **14%** → ~27 lbs retail ⭐ **(+2% over baseline - KEY DIFFERENCE)**
- **Boston Butt:** 8% → ~16 lbs retail (standard)
- **Picnic Shoulder:** 8% → ~16 lbs retail (standard)
- **Spareribs:** 5% → ~10 lbs retail (standard)
- **Head:** 7% → ~14 lbs (slightly smaller proportion)
- **Jowl:** 3% → ~6 lbs (standard)
- **Feet:** 4% → ~8 lbs (standard)

**Belly Specialization Explained:**
Grain finishing causes selective fattening. Belly primal develops more intramuscular and intermuscular fat (marbling + layering) while maintaining meat content. This creates the distinctive **thick, well-marbled bacon** Goldenfields is famous for.

### **Processing Time**

**Total Active Labor:** 11 hours average (+1 hour over baseline)

**Timeline:**
- Initial processing: 1.5-2 hours (larger animal)
- Chilling: 18-24 hours at 34-38°F (grain-fed benefits from longer chill)
- Primal breakdown: 1.5-2 hours
- Retail fabrication: 6-7 hours (+1 hour for careful belly handling)

**Labor Cost:** ~44 sp (11 hours × 4 sp/hour journeyman rate)

**Extra Time Justification:**
Careful belly separation and handling (premium product = premium care). Improper belly cutting can damage bacon potential (waste = significant loss).

## BACON PRODUCTION (PRIMARY PURPOSE)

### **GOLDENFIELDS HERITAGE BACON - The Standard**

**Why This Breed Excels at Bacon:**

1. **Belly Size:** 24 lbs fresh belly (vs 20 lbs baseline) = +20% bacon production
2. **Marbling:** Perfect fat/meat layering (visible striping, even distribution)
3. **Thickness:** 2-2.5 inches (allows thick-cut bacon, uniform slices)
4. **Grain Finishing:** Firm white fat (cleaner flavor, better rendering during cooking)
5. **Length:** Long belly (18-20 inches) = uniform rashers, minimal waste

**Curing Process (Premium Bacon):**

**Dry Cure Formula (per 10 lbs belly):**
- 5 oz kosher salt (coarse)
- 3 oz brown sugar (dark - molasses notes)
- 0.5 oz Prague Powder #1 (sodium nitrite - pink salt)
- 0.25 oz black pepper (coarse ground)
- Optional: 0.1 oz maple sugar (Goldenfields signature sweetness)

**Process:**
1. **Cure application:** Rub cure into belly (all surfaces) - 15 minutes
2. **Curing:** Refrigerate 7-10 days (thicker bellies need longer), flip daily
3. **Rinse & dry:** Rinse cure thoroughly, pat dry - 30 minutes
4. **Equilibration:** Air-dry 12-24 hours (pellicle formation for smoke adhesion)
5. **Cold smoking:** Apple or cherry wood, 65-75°F, 8-12 hours (thick smoke)
6. **Rest:** 24-48 hours refrigerated (flavors meld)
7. **Slice & package:** 1/4 inch slices (thick-cut Goldenfields style)

**Total Time:** 9-12 days (7-10 cure + 1-2 post-smoke rest)
**Active Labor:** 4-5 hours (cure prep, smoking, slicing)

**Yields:**
- 24 lbs fresh pork belly
- → **18 lbs cured bacon** (25% moisture loss - thick cure retains more weight)
- → Packaged as 18× (1 lb packages) thick-cut premium bacon

**Slicing Note:** Goldenfields bacon is traditionally thick-cut (1/4 inch vs 1/8 inch commercial). This showcases the marbling and provides substantial texture. Customers expect "Goldenfields thick-cut" when buying the brand.

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods, Bacon Production, Premium Dry-Cure Method**

---

### **BACON VALUE COMPARISON**

**Fresh Belly vs Cured Bacon (Goldenfields Heritage):**

```
FRESH BELLY:
24 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb = 60 sp

STANDARD CURED BACON (if treated like common pig):
18 lbs @ 4 sp/lb = 72 sp
Value increase: +20% (12 sp profit)

"GOLDENFIELDS BACON" BRANDED:
18 lbs @ 6 sp/lb = 108 sp ⭐
Value increase: +80% (48 sp profit)
```

**Brand Premium Explanation:**

"Goldenfields Bacon" commands 6 sp/lb (vs 4 sp/lb standard bacon) due to:
1. **Brand recognition:** Temple farms, quality reputation
2. **Visible quality:** Thick-cut, excellent marbling (customer can SEE the difference)
3. **Flavor profile:** Grain-fed = milder, sweeter bacon (less gamey than common)
4. **Consistency:** Temple farm standards ensure uniform quality batch-to-batch
5. **Market positioning:** Luxury breakfast item (taverns, wealthy households, gifts)

**Where Sold:**
- Waterdeep Sea Ward markets (nobility)
- High-end taverns (premium breakfast menu item)
- Gift packages (holiday, festivals - bacon as luxury gift)
- Specialty butchers (premium sections, displayed prominently)

**Customer Profile:**
- Nobles/wealthy merchants (can afford 6 sp/lb)
- Tavern owners (menu premium pricing, markup to 1-2 gp per serving)
- Gift buyers (bacon as status gift - "I brought Goldenfields bacon!")
- Bakers (purchasing lard for pastries, add bacon as premium purchase)

---

## HAM PRODUCTION (Secondary Specialty)

Goldenfields Heritage also produces **excellent ham** (grain-fed benefits extend beyond bacon).

### **Short-Cure Smoked Ham**

**Process:** Same as baseline (see Daggerford Farm Pig)

**Yields:**
- 39 lbs fresh ham (both hams)
- → 32 lbs cured smoked ham
- → 2 hams (16 lbs each)

**Value:**
- Fresh: 39 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb = 97.5 sp
- Cured: 32 lbs @ 6 sp/lb = 192 sp ⭐ (+6 sp/lb for Goldenfields brand)
- **VALUE INCREASE: +97% (94.5 sp profit)**

**Brand Premium:** Goldenfields ham commands +1 sp/lb over standard (quality grain-fed meat).

---

### **Long-Cure Aged Ham (6-9 months)**

**Process:** Country-style aging (see Daggerford Farm Pig long-cure method)

**Yields:**
- 39 lbs fresh ham
- → 27 lbs aged ham (9 months)
- → 2 hams (13.5 lbs each)

**Value:**
- Fresh: 97.5 sp
- Aged: 27 lbs @ 11 sp/lb = 297 sp ⭐ (premium aged, Goldenfields quality)
- **VALUE INCREASE: +205% (199.5 sp profit)**

**Quality Note:** Goldenfields Heritage produces **very good** long-cure ham (not exceptional like Cormyrean Black, but superior to common breeds). Grain-fed meat has better flavor development during aging.

---

## SAUSAGE PRODUCTION (Standard Quality)

**From Boston Butt (16 lbs):**

**Yields:**
- 16 lbs Boston Butt → 14 lbs sausage

**Value:**
- Fresh Boston Butt: 16 lbs @ 3 sp/lb = 48 sp
- Fresh sausage: 14 lbs @ 2.5 sp/lb = 35 sp (premium quality, grain-fed)
- Smoked sausage: 12.5 lbs @ 3.5 sp/lb = 43.8 sp

**Note:** Sausage is NOT a specialty for Goldenfields (bacon dominates). Typically Boston Butt sold fresh as roasts (higher value) or used for sausage only if bacon/ham market saturated.

---

## LARD RENDERING (Premium White Lard)

**From 30 lbs raw fat:**

**Yields:**
- 30 lbs raw fat → 28 lbs rendered lard

**Quality Grades:**
- **Premium Leaf Lard:** 10 lbs @ 6 sp/lb = 60 sp (exceptional, grain-fed)
- **Premium Standard Lard:** 18 lbs @ 5 sp/lb = 90 sp (white, neutral, baking-grade)

**Total Lard Value:** 150 sp

**Baker's Premium:**
Waterdeep bakers pay premium for Goldenfields lard. Guild Certified Bakers specifically request "Goldenfields leaf lard" for pie crusts entering competitions. This creates consistent demand at premium prices.

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods, Lard Rendering, Premium Grades**

## CULTURAL NOTES

### **Temple Farm Origins**

**Chauntea's Blessing:**
Goldenfields is a temple-farm complex dedicated to Chauntea (goddess of agriculture). Pig farming is part of agricultural ministry - demonstrating prosperity, abundance, and proper animal husbandry.

**Philosophy:**
- Well-fed animals = blessing manifestation
- Quality over quantity
- Sustainable farming (crop rotation, pasture management)
- Skill transmission (training farmers in best practices)

**Export Mission:**
Temple farms view premium pork production as ministry. Exporting Goldenfields bacon/ham demonstrates agricultural expertise, spreads Chauntea worship (abundance association), and funds temple operations.

## PROFESSIONAL NOTES

**For Butchers:**

**When to Buy Goldenfields Heritage:**
- Customer base includes nobility/wealthy (can afford 6 sp/lb bacon)
- Reputation building (premium inventory elevates shop status)
- Specialty bacon production (thick-cut, branded)
- Lard market (baker customers paying premium)

**When to Buy Daggerford Farm Pig Instead:**
- Cost-conscious customers (common folk primary market)
- Fresh pork sales (premium doesn't justify grain-fed cost for chops)
- High-volume operations (Goldenfields limited availability)

**Preservation Recommendation:**
ALWAYS cure Goldenfields Heritage belly into bacon. Selling fresh wastes 48 sp of value-add. The breed exists for bacon - honor that purpose.

**Quality Control:**
Goldenfields bacon should be thick-cut, visibly marbled, and smoke-forward. Thin-slicing or weak smoke insults the breed and wastes premium investment.

---

**— Thadius Del Irontet**
*"The first time you cure Goldenfields belly, you'll understand why people pay triple. That marbling, that thickness, that grain-fed sweetness - it's not hype. It's just exceptional bacon."*

---

**— Helena Fairstock, Master Provisioner**
*"I've seen apprentice bakers cry with joy when they discover Goldenfields leaf lard. Pie crusts flake like snowflakes. That's not skill - that's the pig."*
