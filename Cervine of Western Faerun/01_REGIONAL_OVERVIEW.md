**Hunting Quality:** Off-season (acceptable meat, but not peak)

**Velvet Antler Harvest (Flamerule-Eleasis):**
- **PEAK VELVET SEASON:** Soft blood-rich antlers (alchemical/medicinal value)
- **Live harvest:** Fallow deer farms (sedate, saw antlers, deer regrows next year)
- **Fresh kill harvest:** Hunt bucks in velvet (process within 12 hours, blood spoils)
- **Velvet value:** 8-120 gp/lb depending on species (whitetail = 8-15 sp/lb, fey deer = 50-120 gp/lb)

**Market Conditions:**
- Fresh venison: -10-15% (off-season, moderate demand)
- Velvet antlers: HIGH DEMAND (Silverymoon alchemists, Waterdeep wizards)

**Best Activity:** Velvet harvest (if farming) OR prepare for fall season

---

## IV. TRANSPORT LOGISTICS & ECONOMICS

### Fresh Venison Transport (Perishable, 3-7 Days Max)

**Time Constraints:**
- **Warm weather (60-80°F):** 3-4 days max (rapid spoilage)
- **Cool weather (40-60°F):** 5-7 days (ideal transport window)
- **Cold weather (20-40°F):** 7-10 days (natural refrigeration)

**Transport Methods:**
- **Cart (local, 0-2 days):** 5-15 sp (Ardeep → Waterdeep, Neverwinter Wood → Neverwinter)
- **Wagon (regional, 2-5 days):** 20-50 sp (High Moor → Waterdeep, ice/salt required)
- **Wagon (long-haul, 5-10 days):** 60-120 sp (ice critical, spoilage risk high)

**Ice/Salt Requirements:**
- **Ice:** 5-10 sp per day (melts, needs replacement)
- **Salt:** 2-4 sp total (rub on meat, preservative, reusable)
- **Economics:** Fresh transport >5 days = often unprofitable (ice cost + spoilage risk)

**Best Fresh Transport Routes:**
- Ardeep/Neverwinter Wood → Waterdeep/Neverwinter (0.5-2 days, profitable)
- Cloakwood → Baldur's Gate (2-3 days, viable)
- **AVOID:** Icewind Dale → anywhere (14+ days, must preserve first)

---

### Preserved Venison Transport (Shelf-Stable, Flexible Timing)

**Preservation Methods:**
- **Smoked venison:** 2-4 months shelf life (cool storage)
- **Jerky:** 6-12 months shelf life (dry, lightweight)
- **Summer sausage:** 3-6 months (with fat added, pork blend)

**Transport Methods:**
- **Wagon (any distance):** 1-2 sp per 10 lbs per 100 miles
- **Ship (coastal/island):** 3-5 sp per 10 lbs per 100 miles
- **Example:** Icewind Dale → Waterdeep (1,000 miles), 100 lbs venison = 100-200 sp freight

**Economics:**
- Preserved venison survives long transport (no spoilage)
- Winter shipping (Nightal-Alturiak) = +30-50% pricing premium
- **ROI:** Preserve in fall (Marpenoth-Uktar), sell in winter (Nightal-Alturiak) = +50-80% total profit

**Best Preserved Transport Routes:**
- Icewind Dale → Luskan → Waterdeep (caribou specialty, 14-21 days)
- Moonshae → Waterdeep (island elk, 3-5 days ship)
- High Moor → Waterdeep (wapiti, 5-7 days wagon)

---

### Antler Transport (Non-Perishable, Zero Spoilage)

**Advantages:**
- No spoilage (indefinite shelf life)
- Lightweight (10-70 lbs per rack depending on species)
- High value density (trophy elk rack = 25-45 gp, 30 lbs weight)

**Transport Costs:**
- **Cart/wagon:** 1 sp per rack (negligible weight)
- **Ship:** 2-3 sp per rack
- **Example:** Giant elk 18-point rack (180-250 gp value, 100 lbs weight) = 5-10 sp freight

**Best Strategy:**
- Ship trophy antlers separately (highest value, lowest weight)
- Sell meat locally or preserve (heavy, perishable)
- **Example:** Hunt elk in High Moor, sell meat in Loudwater (local), ship antlers to Waterdeep (premium)

---

## V. REGIONAL HUNTING REGULATIONS & CULTURAL NOTES

### Cormyr (Southern Heartlands)

**Regulations:**
- Red deer/whitetail: Royal hunting preserves (permits 50-200 gp)
- Trophy stags: Noble privilege (Purple Dragon service or noble connections required)

**Cultural Notes:**
- Deer hunting = prestige (social capital, not profit)
- Poaching = severe (fines 500+ gp, imprisonment)

---

### Neverwinter

**Regulations:**
- Fallow deer parks: Protected (noble estates, trespass = crime)
- Whitetail (Neverwinter Wood): Open season with permit (10-15 sp)

**Cultural Notes:**
- Velvet antler farming = legal industry (Neverwinter nobles)
- Park deer = semi-domestic (do not hunt without permission)

---

### Moonshae Isles

**Regulations:**
- **Fffolk tribal quotas:** 2-3 elk per outsider per season
- **Northlander permissions:** Tribal guide required (20-40 gp)
- Violators banned permanently

**Cultural Notes:**
- Island elk = sacred to Northlanders (respect required)
- Overhunting = tribal conflict (avoid political complications)

---

### Icewind Dale

**Regulations:**
- **Reghed barbarian territories:** Respect tribal hunting grounds
- Caribou quotas: Varies by tribe (coordinate with tribal leaders)
- Violators risk tribal warfare

**Cultural Notes:**
- Caribou = survival resource (Ten-Towns necessity)
- Reghed tribes = primary hunters (outsiders = secondary)
- Migration timing critical (Eleint-Marpenoth, coordinate harvest)

---

## VI. QUICK REFERENCE: REGIONAL DEER SUMMARY

| Region | Primary Species | Population | Access | Best Market | Transport |
|--------|----------------|------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Sword Coast** | Whitetail, Roe, Fallow, Mule | Very High | 0.5-3 days | Waterdeep | Easy (local) |
| **The North** | Whitetail, Caribou, Moose | High | 1-10 days | Neverwinter, Luskan | Moderate |
| **Interior** | Wapiti, Red Deer, Moose | High | 4-8 days | Waterdeep (via wagon) | Hard (remote) |
| **Mountains** | Mule Deer, Giant Elk | Low-Moderate | 2-14 days | Waterdeep (antlers) | Very Hard |
| **Moonshae** | Island Elk | Moderate | 3-5 days (ship) | Waterdeep (export) | Ship only |
| **Fey Crossings** | Moonlit Deer | Very Rare | Unpredictable | Silverymoon, Waterdeep | Varies |

---

## CONCLUSION

**Regional deer distribution is NOT random.** Whitetail deer dominate settled forests (Sword Coast, Heartlands), wapiti/moose dominate remote interior (High Moor, Evermoors), and caribou dominate arctic tundra (Icewind Dale). Understanding these patterns prevents wasted expeditions and maximizes profit through optimal market selection.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Whitetail = easy access, low profit, oversupply** (hunt if local, don't travel far)
- **Wapiti/Moose = remote, high profit, expedition required** (justify 4-8 day travel with 3-5 animal harvest)
- **Caribou = zero expedition cost IF timed to migration** (Eleint-Marpenoth, Ten-Towns)
- **Trophy bulls = Waterdeep export** (premium antler market, worth long-haul freight)
- **Preserved venison = winter sales** (Nightal-Alturiak +30-50% premium, plan ahead)

**Next chapter covers universal cervine processing - the 7 primals, lean meat techniques, and baseline yields that apply to ALL 12 breeds.**
