**Rarity:** Uncommon to Rare
**Conservation Status:** Stable (remote populations, limited harvest pressure)

---

## I. BREED OVERVIEW

### The Pinnacle of Common Cervine Hunting

Wapiti elk represent the **largest cervine** accessible without entering giant/magical beast territory. Where red deer (325 lbs) bridge common deer to large game, wapiti are **unquestionably large game** - requiring expeditions, specialized equipment, and experienced hunters.

**KEY CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Massive Size:** 600-900 lbs bulls (1.8-2.8x red deer, 4-6x whitetail)
- **Expedition Required:** 5-15 days (vs red deer 2-4 days, whitetail 1-3 days)
- **Dangerous:** CR 1/4 (bulls can kill during rut, charge/gore hunters)
- **Huge Yield:** 200-300 lbs retail (2-3x red deer, 4-6x whitetail)
- **Trophy Focus:** Many hunters seek antlers > meat (6-point bulls = 300-800 sp antler value)
- **Iconic Bugling:** Echoing calls across High Moor (hunting cue, intimidation display)
- **High Investment:** 150-350 gp total cost (expedition 50-150 gp + processing 30-50 gp + permits 20-50 sp)
- **High Reward:** 220-280 gp gross value (meat 120-180 gp + antlers 50-100 gp + hide 8-15 gp)

**MARKET POSITION:** Wapiti occupy the **"luxury bulk expedition meat"** niche. One bull provides:
- **Family Supply:** 6-12 months of meat (200-300 lbs)
- **Group Investment:** 3-5 hunters pool resources (split costs, share meat)
- **Trophy Component:** 40-60% of hunters prioritize antlers (meat is valuable byproduct)
- **Status Symbol:** Successfully hunting wapiti = skill/wealth demonstration

## II. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

### Primary Range (High Moor - Remote Wilderness)

**HIGH MOOR (Core Population):**
- **Central High Moor:** 2,500-4,000 individuals (most dense, far from civilization)
- **Eastern High Moor:** 1,500-2,500 individuals (transitions to Anauroch desert)
- **Western High Moor:** 1,000-2,000 individuals (approaches Evermoor, moose overlap)
- **Elevation:** 2,000-6,000 ft (high plateau, open meadows + scattered forest)
- **Total High Moor:** 5,000-8,500 individuals

**ACCESS CHALLENGES:**
- **Distance from Waterdeep:** 12-18 days round trip (250-350 miles, rough terrain)
- **No Cart Roads:** Entirely pack animal / on-foot access
- **Seasonal Access:** Eleint-Marpenoth only (summer = dangerous weather, winter = impassable snow)
- **Expedition Base:** Secomber OR Loudwater (staging points, 6-10 days to High Moor interior)

**RESULT:** Wapiti hunting is **NOT casual**. It requires:
- **Planning:** 2-4 tendays advance (permits, equipment, guides, pack animals)
- **Investment:** 50-150 gp expedition costs (before harvesting a single elk)
- **Commitment:** 10-20 days total (travel + hunt + return)
- **Risk:** Wilderness hazards (CR 1/4 elk, weather, predators, getting lost)

---

### Secondary Range (Scattered Populations)

**NETHER MOUNTAINS (Northern Range):**
- **Southern Valleys:** 800-1,500 individuals (isolated pockets)
- **Elevation:** 3,000-7,000 ft
- **Access:** Silver Marches (Silverymoon, Sundabar) = 8-12 days

**GRAYPEAK MOUNTAINS (Western Slopes):**
- **High Valleys:** 500-1,000 individuals (limited suitable habitat)
- **Elevation:** 4,000-8,000 ft
- **Access:** Secomber/Llorkh = 7-12 days

**TOTAL WAPITI POPULATION (Western Faerûn):** 6,300-11,000 individuals (rarest "common" cervine in this guide)

---

### Antler Characteristics (MASSIVE)

**STRUCTURE (Defining Feature):**

Wapiti antlers are **among the largest of any cervine** in Western Faerûn (only moose/giant elk exceed them):

**TYPICAL MATURE BULL (6-Point, 5-7 years):**
- **Main Beam:** Long, sweeping backward curve (40-55 inches along curve)
- **Brow Tine (G1):** Points forward (12-18 inches, thick as human wrist)
- **Bez Tine (G2):** Points upward/forward (10-16 inches, diagnostic of elk family)
- **Trez Tine (G3):** Points upward (8-14 inches)
- **Fourth Point (G4):** Points upward (6-12 inches)
- **Fifth Point (G5):** Points upward (4-10 inches)
- **Sixth Point (G6):** Rear sword point (curves inward, 6-14 inches)
- **Total Points:** 12 points typical (6 per side, "6×6" or "royal bull")

**AGE-BASED DEVELOPMENT:**
- **2.5 years (Raghorn):** 4-6 points total, spindly beams (18-24 inches)
- **3.5 years:** 8-10 points, bez tines develop (30-36 inches beams)
- **4.5 years:** 10-12 points (4-5 per side, 36-44 inches beams)
- **5-7 years (Mature):** 12 points (6×6, 40-50 inches beams, **PRIME TROPHY**)
- **8-10 years (Trophy):** 12-14 points (6×6 or 7×6, 48-55 inches beams, heavy mass)
- **10+ years (Monarch):** 14+ points (7×7 or irregular, massive beams/mass, rare)

**ANTLER MEASUREMENTS:**
- **Main Beam Length:** 40-55 inches (vs red deer 24-36 inches, whitetail 18-24 inches)
- **Inside Spread:** 36-50 inches (vs red deer 20-32 inches, whitetail 12-18 inches)
- **Brow Tine Length:** 12-18 inches (longer than entire whitetail antler)
- **Circumference (Base):** 8-12 inches (thick as human forearm)
- **Mass (Weight):** 8-15 lbs per antler (vs red deer 3-6 lbs, whitetail 1-2 lbs)

**GROWTH CYCLE (Same Timing as All Cervines):**
- **Ches-Tarsakh:** Shedding (bulls shed Ches, massive antlers hit ground with thud)
- **Mirtul-Flamerule:** Velvet growth (3-5 inches per week, requires massive nutrient intake)
- **Flamerule-Eleasis:** Peak velvet (4-8 lbs velvet per bull, alchemical value 50-200 gp)
- **Eleasis:** Velvet stripping (bulls thrash trees, sometimes break saplings)
- **Eleint-Alturiak:** Hardened antlers (rut + winter, dark staining from mud/sap)
- **Ches:** Shedding begins anew

---

**ANTLER VALUE (Hardened, Trophy Scoring):**

**TYPICAL 6×6 BULL (Mature, 5-7 years):**
- **Good 6×6:** 300-500 sp (40-45 inch beams, moderate mass, symmetric)
- **Quality 6×6:** 500-800 sp (45-50 inch beams, heavy mass, good symmetry)
- **Trophy 6×6:** 800-1,200 sp (50-55 inch beams, very heavy mass, excellent symmetry)

**EXCEPTIONAL BULLS:**
- **7×6 or 6×7 (Irregular Royal):** 1,000-1,500 sp (extra point, heavy mass)
- **7×7 (Imperial):** 1,500-2,500 sp (14 points, massive, rare)
- **Record Class (8+ points per side):** 2,500-5,000 sp (museum quality, guild certified)

**VELVET ANTLERS (Alchemical Harvest):**
- **Mature Bull (6-8 lbs velvet):** 20-35 gp/lb = 120-280 gp total
- **Live Harvest:** Extremely difficult (sedating 750 lb bull = dangerous, expensive)
- **Fresh Kill Harvest:** Flamerule-Eleasis culling (limited permits, 100-200 gp permit cost)

**MARKET DYNAMICS:**
- **Antlers often = 40-60% of total bull value** (300-800 sp antlers vs 600-1,200 sp meat)
- **Trophy Hunters:** Many accept lower meat quality (rut bulls) for peak antler size
- **Meat Hunters:** Target cows OR pre-rut bulls (smaller antlers, better meat)

---

## IV. SEASONAL BIOLOGY AND RUT BEHAVIOR

### Annual Cycle

**SPRING (Ches-Mirtul):**
- **Ches-Tarsakh:** Antler shedding (bulls), late pregnancy (cows, 240-260 day gestation)
- **Mirtul:** Calving (1 calf typical, twins rare, cows seek dense forest)

**SUMMER (Kythorn-Eleasis):**
- **Kythorn-Flamerule:** High elevation meadows (6,000-8,000 ft, alpine grazing)
- **Flamerule-Eleasis:** Peak velvet (bulls), calf rearing (cows), fattening

**FALL (Eleint-Uktar) - HUNTING SEASON & RUT:**
- **Eleint:** Migration to lower elevations (4,000-5,000 ft), pre-rut fattening
- **Marpenoth:** **RUT SEASON PEAK** (bugling, fighting, **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS**)
- **Uktar:** Post-rut (bulls exhausted, 30-40% body weight loss)

**WINTER (Nightal-Alturiak):**
- **Nightal-Alturiak:** Low elevation yarding (3,000-4,000 ft, survival mode)
- **Condition:** Bulls 4-6% body fat, cows 6-8% body fat

---

### Rut Season (Marpenoth) - DANGEROUS CR 1/4 BEHAVIOR

**TIMING:** Marpenoth (same as whitetail/red deer), but **wapiti rut is the MOST INTENSE and MOST DANGEROUS** of any common cervine.

**BUGLING (Iconic Sound):**
- **Description:** High-pitched scream transitioning to deep grunt (3-5 second call)
- **Audible Range:** 1-3 miles (echoes across High Moor valleys)
- **Frequency:** Constant during peak rut (10-30 bugles per hour for dominant bulls)
- **Purpose:** Attract cows, intimidate rival bulls, territory proclamation
- **Hunting Use:** Bugling reveals bull locations (hunters can call bulls using artificial bugles)

**WALLOWING:**
- **Behavior:** Bulls dig mud wallows (6-10 ft diameter, 1-2 ft deep)
- **Urination:** Bulls urinate in wallow, roll in mud (coat entire body)
- **Scent:** Overpowering musky/urine odor (permeates meat, detectable 100+ yards)
- **Result:** Rut bull meat is **EXTREMELY GAMEY** (worst of any cervine, including moose)

**FIGHTING:**
- **Intensity:** Violent, potentially fatal (antler-locking, goring, trampling)
- **Injuries:** 10-15% of mature bulls injured per rut (broken antlers common, puncture wounds from goring)
- **Duration:** Battles 10-45 minutes (vs whitetail 1-5 minutes, red deer 5-30 minutes)
- **Fatalities:** 1-3% of bulls die from injuries (exhaustion, infected wounds, locked antlers)

**AGGRESSION TOWARD HUMANS (CR 1/4):**
- **Charge Distance:** Bulls charge perceived threats within 50-100 yards
- **Charge Speed:** 35-40 mph (short bursts, surprisingly fast for size)
- **Attack Method:** Lower head, gore with brow tines (12-18 inch spikes), trample
- **Fatality Risk:** **REAL** (several documented hunter deaths per decade in High Moor region)
- **Professional Guidance:** **"Do NOT approach rut bulls within 100 yards. If bull bugles at you, LEAVE."**

**HAREM BEHAVIOR:**
- **Bulls Gather Cows:** Dominant bulls defend harems (10-30 cows)
- **Constant Herding:** Bulls chase cows, keep harem together (exhausting behavior)
- **Feeding Negligible:** Bulls eat 10-20% of normal intake (focused entirely on reproduction)

---

**MEAT QUALITY IMPACT (Rut Bulls):**
- **Flavor:** **EXTREME** gamey (testosterone + wallowing + urine + stress = nearly inedible as steaks)
- **Texture:** Tough (glycogen depleted, dark muscle, stringy)
- **Fat Content:** 3-5% (vs pre-rut 8-10%, 50% reduction)
- **Color:** Very dark red to purplish (oxidized myoglobin, poor aging potential)
- **Professional Standard:** **"Rut bulls = sausage/jerky ONLY, add 50% pork fat + heavy spicing to mask flavor"**

**OPTIMAL HARVEST STRATEGIES:**

**Trophy Hunters (Antlers Priority):**
- **Target:** Rut bulls (Marpenoth), peak antler hardness + size
- **Accept:** Poor meat quality (plan for grinding/sausage)
- **Danger:** Acknowledge CR 1/4 risk (experienced hunters, firearm backup)

**Meat Hunters (Quality Priority):**
- **Target:** Cows (Eleint-Marpenoth) OR pre-rut bulls (early Eleint)
- **Accept:** Smaller/no antlers (bulls shed antlers, cows never have them)
- **Advantage:** Excellent meat quality (8-12% body fat, mild flavor, tender)

---

## V. EXPEDITION HUNTING LOGISTICS

### Pre-Expedition Planning

**TIMING:**
- **Best Season:** Eleint (pre-rut, bulls fattened, weather stable, 60-70°F)
- **Trophy Season:** Marpenoth (rut, largest antlers, but dangerous + poor meat)
- **Avoid:** Uktar-Eleasis (post-rut poor quality, winter access impossible, summer storms)

**PERMITS:**
- **High Moor Elk Tag (Waterdeep Jurisdiction):** 20-50 sp per hunter (limited issue, lottery system, 30-50% draw rate)
- **Trophy Bull Tag (6-point minimum):** 50-100 sp (very limited, <20% draw rate)
- **Cow Tag:** 10-20 sp (more available, population management)

**EXPEDITION GROUP SIZE:**
- **Solo:** NOT RECOMMENDED (dangerous, carcass too heavy, wilderness risk)
- **2 Hunters:** Minimum (buddy system, can handle 1 bull with effort)
- **3-5 Hunters:** OPTIMAL (can harvest 2-3 elk, share costs, safer)
- **6+ Hunters:** Large group (commercial outfitter, 5-10 elk, expensive)

---

### Expedition Costs (3-Hunter Group, 10-Day Hunt)

**TRANSPORTATION:**
- **Pack Animals (Mules):** 6-8 mules @ 5 gp/mule/tenday = 30-40 gp
- **Guide (Experienced):** 50-100 gp (knows High Moor, elk behavior, butchering)
- **Pack Handler:** 20-30 gp (manages mules, camp setup)

**PROVISIONS:**
- **Food (10 days, 3 people + 2 staff):** 15-25 gp (trail rations, grain for mules)
- **Camping Gear (Tents, bedding):** 10-20 gp (rental if not owned)

**EQUIPMENT:**
- **Weapons/Ammunition:** 5-15 gp (arrows, bolts, backup weapons)
- **Butchering Tools:** 3-5 gp (large knives, saws, rope, cloth)

**CONTINGENCY:**
- **Emergency Fund:** 10-20 gp (injury, extended hunt, lost equipment)

**TOTAL EXPEDITION COST (Per Group):**
- **Minimum:** 143 gp (bare-bones, experienced hunters, own gear)
- **Typical:** 200-300 gp (guided, provisioned, comfortable)
- **Luxury:** 400-600 gp (outfitter, multiple staff, guaranteed success)

**PER-HUNTER COST (3-Hunter Group):**
- **Shared Costs:** 50-100 gp per hunter (expedition divided 3 ways)
- **Individual Costs:** 20-50 sp (personal permit, personal gear)
- **TOTAL PER HUNTER:** 50-150 gp

**ECONOMIC REALITY:** Wapiti hunting requires **significant upfront investment** before harvesting a single elk. This limits participation to:
- **Wealthy Individuals:** Nobles, successful merchants (150 gp = minor expense)
- **Group Pooling:** Middle-class hunters combine resources (3-5 people share costs)
- **Professional Hunters:** Make living from selling meat/antlers (business investment)

---

### Field Harvesting (Large Carcass Challenges)

**SHOT PLACEMENT:**
- **Vital Zone:** 16-20 inches diameter (large target, but thick-bodied)
- **Arrow Penetration Required:** 16-24 inches (deep chest, heavy muscle/bone)
- **Broadside MANDATORY:** Quartering shots often fail (shoulder bones stop arrows)
- **Firearm Backup:** Many hunters carry crossbow + light crossbow (heavier bolt for insurance)

**FIELD DRESSING TIME:**
- **Experienced (2 people):** 45-75 minutes (750 lb bull, HEAVY)
- **Novice (2 people):** 90-120 minutes
- **Solo (Experienced):** 90-150 minutes (extremely difficult, not recommended)

**FIELD DRESSED WEIGHT:**
- **Live Weight:** 750 lbs
- **Dressing %:** 65% (same as all cervines)
- **Field Dressed:** 750 × 65% = **488 lbs** (vs red deer 211 lbs, whitetail 117 lbs)

**IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES:**
- **Weight:** 488 lbs = TOO HEAVY to move (must quarter immediately)
- **Cooling:** Large mass retains heat (must open cavity, prop with sticks, priority in warm weather)
- **Predators:** Scent attracts wolves, bears (must process quickly, hang meat high if overnight)

---

### Quartering (MANDATORY for All Wapiti)

**NO WHOLE-CARCASS TRANSPORT:** Even with wagon, 750 lbs too heavy for most carts. Quartering is universal.

**QUARTERING PROCEDURE:**

**1. REMOVE FRONT LEGS (SHOULDERS):**
- **Cut:** Separate shoulder from rib cage (muscle only, no bone sawing)
- **Weight:** 60-85 lbs each (vs red deer 35-45 lbs, **75% heavier**)
- **Challenge:** Requires 2 people to lift/maneuver

**2. REMOVE HIND LEGS (HAMS):**
- **Cut:** Through hip joint OR disarticulate ball-and-socket
- **Weight:** 85-115 lbs each (vs red deer 50-65 lbs, **70-75% heavier**)
- **Challenge:** VERY HEAVY, awkward shape, 2 people required

**3. REMOVE BACKSTRAPS:**
- **Cut:** Along spine, peel from ribs (24-36 inches long)
- **Weight:** 8-12 lbs each (16-24 lbs total)
- **Premium:** Most valuable cut per pound

**4. REMOVE TENDERLOINS:**
- **Cut:** Inside body cavity, along spine
- **Weight:** 2-3 lbs each (4-6 lbs total)
- **Premium:** Rarest cut

**5. RIBS (Optional, Usually LEFT):**
- **Weight:** 25-35 lbs (heavy, lower value per pound)
- **Decision:** If pack capacity allows, take (smoking/braising)
- **Common:** Left for scavengers (prioritize high-value cuts)

**6. NECK (Usually LEFT):**
- **Weight:** 20-30 lbs (grinding meat, low priority)
- **Common:** Left in field

**QUARTER WEIGHTS (750 lb Wapiti):**
- Front Quarters (2): 60-85 lbs each = 120-170 lbs total
- Hind Quarters (2): 85-115 lbs each = 170-230 lbs total
- Backstraps: 16-24 lbs
- Tenderloins: 4-6 lbs
- **PACKED TOTAL:** 310-430 lbs

**PACK ANIMAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **5-7 Mules (Standard):** Each carries 60-70 lbs (total capacity 300-490 lbs)
- **Note:** This is for ONE bull (3-hunter group might harvest 2-3 bulls = 10-20 mules needed)

---

## VI. BUTCHER SHOP PROCESSING

### Yield Calculation (750 lb Wapiti Bull)

**STEP 1: Live to Dressed (65%)**
- Live Weight: 750 lbs
- Dressing %: 65%
- Dressed Weight: 750 × 65% = **488 lbs**

**STEP 2: Dressed to Retail (45%)**
- Dressed Weight: 488 lbs
- Retail %: 45%
- Retail Weight: 488 × 45% = **220 lbs**

**FINAL TOTAL YIELD:** 29% (750 lbs live → 220 lbs retail)

**YIELD COMPARISON:**
| Cervine | Live | Dressed | Retail | Retail % |
|---------|------|---------|--------|----------|
| Whitetail | 150 lbs | 98 lbs | 44 lbs | 29% |
| Red Deer | 325 lbs | 211 lbs | 95 lbs | 29% |
| **Wapiti** | **750 lbs** | **488 lbs** | **220 lbs** | **29%** |
| Moose | 1,200 lbs | 780 lbs | 351 lbs | 29% |

**VALUE PROPOSITION:** One wapiti bull = **5x whitetail** (220 lbs vs 44 lbs) OR **2.3x red deer** (220 lbs vs 95 lbs) in single harvest.

- **Rate:** 4 sp/hour per person
- **Cost:** 96-128 sp = **9.6-12.8 gp** (vs red deer 3.6-4.8 gp, whitetail 2.4-3.2 gp)

---

### Secondary Breakdown

**SAME OPTIONS AS SMALLER CERVINES,** but **feast-sized portions**:

**SHOULDERS (145-170 lbs total):**
- **Roasts:** 4-6 roasts, 25-35 lbs each (**HUGE**, serve 20-30 people per roast)
- **Grinding:** 70-90 lbs ground venison (massive volume)

**HAMS (220-270 lbs total):**
- **Steaks:** 70-110 steaks, 2-3 lbs each (serve 2-3 people per steak)
- **Roasts:** 10-14 roasts, 18-25 lbs each (feast-sized, serve 15-20 people)

- **Steaks:** 25-35 steaks, 10-14 oz each (premium individual portions)

**CUSTOMER DECISIONS:**
- **Large Families:** Whole elk = year supply (220 lbs = 50-75 lbs per quarter-year)
- **Group Purchases:** 3-5 families split (each gets 45-75 lbs)
- **Commercial:** Taverns, institutions (buy whole elk, 3-6 months inventory)

---

### Aging (EXTENDED Required)

**WAPITI REQUIRE LONGEST AGING OF ANY COMMON CERVINE:**

**Reasons:**
- **Largest Muscles:** Massive muscle mass = most connective tissue = longest breakdown
- **Oldest Animals:** Trophy bulls 6-10 years (vs whitetail 2-4 years, older = tougher)
- **Active Lifestyle:** Mountainous terrain = very dense muscle fibers

**AGING SCHEDULE:**
- **Minimum:** 16-18 days (vs red deer 12-14 days, whitetail 7-10 days)
- **Standard:** 18-21 days (recommended for all but youngest bulls/cows)
- **Extended:** 21-28 days (trophy bulls 8+ years, maximum tenderness)
- **Temperature:** 34-38°F
- **Humidity:** 70-75%

**PROFESSIONAL WARNING:** "Cutting wapiti at 12 days yields shoe-leather steaks. MINIMUM 18 days or face angry customers."

## VIII. CULINARY APPLICATIONS

### Meat Quality

**TASTE:**
- **Richest Cervine Flavor:** More pronounced than red deer, much stronger than whitetail (beefy, gamey, wild)
- **Rut Bulls:** EXTREME (nearly inedible as steaks, must grind + heavy spicing)
- **Cows/Pre-Rut Bulls:** Rich but pleasant (appeals to game meat enthusiasts, too strong for some)

**TEXTURE:**
- **Coarse Grain:** Largest muscle fibers (noticeable texture, not silky like roe deer)
- **Requires Aging:** 18-21 days mandatory (properly aged = tender, under-aged = tough)

**FAT CONTENT:**
- **Pre-Rut:** 8-10% body fat (same as other cervines)
- **Intramuscular Fat:** Minimal (lean game meat, very little marbling)

---

### Cooking Techniques

**ALL CERVINE TECHNIQUES APPLY** (see § 02_SWORD_COAST_WHITETAIL), but **wapiti benefits from strong flavors**:

**RECOMMENDED PREPARATIONS:**
- **Strong Marinades:** Red wine + juniper + rosemary (24-48 hours, complement strong flavor)
- **Braising:** Shoulders/shanks (slow cooking tenderizes, rich gravy balances flavor)
- **Smoking:** Ground elk + pork fat (50/50) = excellent smoked sausage
- **Jerky:** Lean meat ideal for drying (elk jerky = traditional trail food)

---

### Recipe: High Moor Elk Feast Roast

**OCCASION:** Major celebrations (weddings, military victories, temple festivals)

**INGREDIENTS:**
- Wapiti shoulder roast (bone-in), 30 lbs
- Red wine (3 bottles), dark beer (2 bottles)
- Onions (8 large), carrots (12), turnips (8)
- Juniper berries (4 Tbsp, crushed), rosemary (15 sprigs), thyme (20 sprigs)
- Garlic (3 heads, cloves inserted)
- Butter (1.5 lbs, basting)
- Salt, black pepper, bay leaves (6)

**METHOD:**
1. **Marinate:** 48 hours (wine, beer, herbs, refrigerated)
2. **Sear:** 500°F oven, 45 minutes (brown exterior)
3. **Braise:** 275°F oven, 8-12 hours (covered, baste every 45 minutes, to 190°F internal)
4. **Rest:** 45 minutes
5. **Carve:** Against grain, 1/4-inch slices

**SERVING:** Serves 40-60 people (3-4 oz cooked meat per person + sides)

**COST:**
- Elk shoulder: 40-60 gp (1/4 of bull value)
- Ingredients: 20-30 gp (wine, beer, vegetables, butter, herbs)
- Labor (chef + assistants): 25-40 gp (12-16 hours prep/cooking)
- **TOTAL:** 85-130 gp

**CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE:** Serving whole wapiti roast = **major status display** (shows wealth to afford expedition, generosity to share bulk meat, connection to professional hunters).
