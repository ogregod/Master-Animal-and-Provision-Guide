## XI. COOKING METHODS GUIDE

### **INTERNAL TEMPERATURE CHART (VENISON)**

| Doneness | Internal Temp | Description | Recommended For |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Rare** | 120-125°F | Cool red center | Backstrap, tenderloin ONLY |
| **Medium-Rare** | 130-135°F | Warm red center | **IDEAL for all premium cuts** |
| **Medium** | 140-145°F | Warm pink center | Acceptable for steaks, roasts |
| **Medium-Well** | 150-155°F | Slightly pink center | Ham, round (lean cuts) |
| **Well-Done** | 160°F+ | No pink, grey throughout | **NOT RECOMMENDED** (dry, tough) |

**CRITICAL:** Venison is 97-98% lean (vs beef 75-85% lean), overcooking = DRY, TOUGH

**BEST PRACTICE:**
- **Pull 5-10°F below target** (carry-over cooking during rest)
- **Rest 5-15 minutes** (depending on size)
- **Slice against grain** (maximizes tenderness)

### **COOKING TIME CHARTS**

**GRILLING (High heat, direct flame)**

| Cut | Thickness | Time per Side | Target Temp |
|-----|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Backstrap steak | 1-1.5" | 3-4 min | 130-135°F |
| Sirloin steak | 1" | 4-5 min | 135-140°F |
| Shoulder steak | 3/4-1" | 4-5 min | 140-145°F (marinate first) |
| Round steak | 3/4" | 3-4 min | 140-145°F (marinate first) |
| Rib chops | 1-1.5" | 3-5 min | 130-135°F |

---

**ROASTING (Oven, dry heat)**

| Cut | Oven Temp | Time per Pound | Target Temp |
|-----|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Whole backstrap | 400°F | 8-12 min/lb | 125-130°F (pull early) |
| Standing rib roast | 325-350°F | 20-25 min/lb | 130-135°F |
| Sirloin roast | 325°F | 20-25 min/lb | 135-145°F |
| Round roast | 300°F | 25-30 min/lb | 145-155°F |
| Shoulder roast | 300°F | 25-30 min/lb | 150-160°F |

---

**BRAISING (Low, slow, liquid)**

| Cut | Temp | Time | Target |
|-----|------|------|--------|
| Neck roasts | 275-300°F | 6-8 hours | Fork-tender, bone pulls away |
| Shoulder roasts | 275-300°F | 4-6 hours | Fall-apart tender |
| Shanks (osso buco) | 275-300°F | 6-8 hours | Meat falls off bone |
| Round roasts (braised) | 275°F | 4-5 hours | Fork-tender |

---

### **MARINADE RECOMMENDATIONS**

**WHEN TO MARINATE:**
- **ALWAYS:** Shoulder steaks, round steaks (tough cuts)
- **OPTIONAL:** Sirloin steaks, rib chops (improves flavor)
- **NEVER:** Backstrap, tenderloin (already tender, marinade unnecessary)

**BASIC MARINADE FORMULA:**
- **Acid:** 1/4 cup (red wine, vinegar, citrus juice) - tenderizes
- **Oil:** 1/4 cup (olive, vegetable) - moisture, flavor carrier
- **Aromatics:** Garlic, onions, herbs (rosemary, thyme, juniper)
- **Salt:** 1 tsp (flavor, moisture retention)
- **Time:** 4-12 hours (refrigerate)

**EXAMPLE MARINADE (for 2 lbs shoulder steaks):**
- 1/4 cup red wine
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper
- **Mix, pour over steaks, refrigerate 6-8 hours, grill**

## XII. CUT SUBSTITUTION GUIDE

### **VENISON-TO-VENISON SUBSTITUTIONS**

**If you want backstrap but don't have it:**
1. **Tenderloin** (very similar, equally tender)
2. **Rib chops** (nearly as tender, bone-in)
3. **Sirloin steaks** (slightly less tender, but good)

**If you want shoulder roast but don't have it:**
1. **Round roast** (similar toughness, slower cook)
2. **Neck roast** (tougher, but similar applications)
3. **Shanks** (very tough, longest cook)

**If you want ground venison but don't have it:**
1. **Cube shoulder/neck meat** (stew instead of ground)
2. **Thinly slice round** (stir-fry instead of ground)
3. **Make sausage** (different product, but uses trim)

---

### **VENISON-TO-BEEF SUBSTITUTIONS**

**For recipes calling for beef:**

| Beef Cut | Venison Equivalent | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Beef tenderloin | Venison backstrap/tenderloin | Use same recipe, reduce cook time 10-20% (leaner) |
| Ribeye steak | Venison rib chops | Similar tenderness, less fat |
| Sirloin steak | Venison sirloin steak | Very similar |
| Chuck roast | Venison shoulder roast | Same slow-cook applications |
| Beef round | Venison round/ham | Same (tough, lean, roasts) |
| Ground beef | Ground venison | Add 5-10% fat for juiciness |

**KEY DIFFERENCE:** Venison is leaner, cook 10-20% less time OR lower temp (avoid drying out)

---

### **VENISON-TO-PORK SUBSTITUTIONS**

| Pork Cut | Venison Equivalent | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Pork tenderloin | Venison backstrap | Similar shape, venison leaner |
| Pork chops | Venison rib chops, sirloin steaks | Venison less fatty |
| Pork shoulder | Venison shoulder | Same slow-cook applications |
| Pork shank | Venison shank | Same (osso buco) |
| Ground pork | Ground venison + 10% pork fat | Mix for sausage, burgers |

## CONCLUSION

This appendix provides comprehensive reference for all cervine cuts, cooking methods, and pricing structures. Key takeaways:

**BEST VALUE CUTS:**
- Ground venison (versatile, budget-friendly)
- Shoulder roasts (good quality, moderate price)
- Shanks (cheap, incredible flavor if cooked properly)

**PREMIUM CUTS (worth the splurge):**
- Backstrap steaks (most tender, worth 2-3x neck prices)
- Rib roasts (tender, impressive presentation)
- Whole backstrap roast (special occasions)

**PROCESSING TIPS:**
- Use 65% × 45% = 29% formula (universal across breeds)
- Don't overcook venison (lean = dries out quickly)
- Marinade tough cuts (shoulder, round steaks)
- Braise shanks/neck 6-8 hours (collagen = gelatin = amazing)

**PRICING STRATEGY:**
- Premium cuts (backstrap, rib) = 2-3x basic cuts (neck, shank)
- Wholesale = 25-35% discount (bulk buyers)
- Ground venison extends value of tough cuts (2-4 sp/lb)

**Use this appendix as your go-to reference for cutting, pricing, and cooking all Western Faerûn cervines.**
