---

## I. BREED OVERVIEW

### The Semi-Domesticated Deer

Fallow deer occupy a unique position among Western Faerûn cervines: they are **neither fully wild nor fully domestic**. For centuries, noble houses have maintained park populations, selectively breeding for:
- **Aesthetic Beauty:** Spotted coats, palmated antlers (decorative landscaping animals)
- **Docility:** Calm temperament (safe around estate grounds, easy handling)
- **Consistent Meat Quality:** Managed feeding (grain supplements, predictable flavor)

**KEY CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Distinctive Spotted Coat:** White spots on reddish-brown (summer), maintained year-round in some individuals
- **Palmated Antlers:** Flattened, shovel-like antler tips (unique among Western Faerûn deer)
- **Size Range:** 120-200 lbs (similar to whitetail, but more variable due to selective breeding)
- **Dual Population:** Wild forests (40%) vs Estate parks (60%)
- **Docile Temperament:** Less wary than whitetail/mule deer (easier hunting/handling)

**MARKET POSITION:** Fallow deer bridge the gap between wild game and domestic livestock. They offer **predictable quality** (estate-raised) while maintaining **game meat appeal** (wild flavor, not farmyard). This makes them popular for noble feasts, tavern specials, and institutional buyers (military, temples) seeking reliable venison.

## II. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

### Wild Populations

**NEVERWINTER WOOD (Primary Wild Range):**
- **Southern Neverwinter Wood:** 1,500-2,500 individuals (closest to Neverwinter, 1-2 days)
- **Central Neverwinter Wood:** 1,000-1,800 individuals (mixed with whitetail)
- **Scattered Pockets:** 500-1,000 individuals (isolated groups, descended from escaped estate deer)
- **Total Wild:** 3,000-5,300 individuals

**SECONDARY WILD RANGE:**
- **Ardeep Forest (Northern):** 800-1,500 individuals (overlap with whitetail/roe deer)
- **Mere of Dead Men (Edges):** 300-600 individuals (limited, marginal habitat)

**TOTAL WILD POPULATION:** 4,100-7,400 individuals (less abundant than whitetail in wild)

---

### Estate Park Populations

**SEMI-DOMESTICATED PARKS (60% of Total Population):**

Fallow deer are the **most commonly maintained park deer** in Western Faerûn due to:
- **Visual Appeal:** Spotted coats beautiful (landscaping feature, impresses guests)
- **Easy Management:** Docile, tolerate fencing, simple feeding requirements
- **Reliable Meat:** Year-round harvest possible (controlled population, sustainable yield)

**MAJOR ESTATE POPULATIONS:**

**NEVERWINTER REGION:**
- **Lord's Keep (Neverwinter):** 120-180 fallow deer (largest single park, Lord Neverember's estate)
- **Minor Noble Estates (10-15 families):** 300-500 deer total (20-40 deer per estate)

**WATERDEEP REGION:**
- **Noble Villas (Various Houses):** 200-350 deer total (Thann, Wands, Husteem, others)
- **Waterdeep Palace Grounds:** 40-60 deer (ceremonial hunts, Lord's Open feast)

**BALDUR'S GATE / SOUTHERN COAST:**
- **Ducal Estates:** 150-250 deer (multiple estates, patriar families)

**DAGGERFORD / INLAND:**
- **Duke's Park:** 80-120 deer (managed hunting park)
- **Minor Estates:** 100-200 deer (scattered small parks)

**TOTAL ESTATE POPULATION:** 6,000-10,000 individuals (exceeds wild population)

**COMBINED TOTAL POPULATION (Wild + Estate):** 10,100-17,400 individuals (most abundant fallow deer in Western Faerûn)

---

## III. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### Coat Variations (Selective Breeding)

Unlike whitetail or mule deer (consistent coloration), fallow deer exhibit **FOUR distinct color morphs** due to centuries of selective breeding:

**1. COMMON (SPOTTED) - 60% of Population:**
- **Summer:** Reddish-brown base with white spots (2-4 mm diameter, 100-200 spots), white belly
- **Winter:** Grayish-brown with faint spots (spots persist year-round, unlike fawn spots that fade)
- **Identifying Features:** Black dorsal stripe (spine), white rump patch with black border
- **Market Preference:** HIGHEST demand (classic "park deer" appearance)

**2. MENIL (PALE) - 20% of Population:**
- **Year-Round:** Pale tan to cream base with white spots (lighter overall than common)
- **No Seasonal Change:** Coat color stable (same summer/winter)
- **Market Preference:** High (unusual appearance, estate specialty breeding)

**3. MELANISTIC (DARK) - 15% of Population:**
- **Year-Round:** Dark chocolate brown to black, NO spots visible (spots present genetically, but masked)
- **Summer:** Slightly lighter (dark brown)
- **Winter:** Nearly black
- **Market Preference:** Moderate (less decorative, but exotic appeal)

**4. LEUCISTIC (WHITE) - 5% of Population:**
- **Year-Round:** White to cream, NO spots (true leucism, not albinism = dark eyes)
- **Rarity:** Highly selectively bred (nobles pay premium for white deer in parks)
- **Market Preference:** VERY HIGH (rare, 2-3x value for live animals, meat value same as others)

**PROFESSIONAL NOTE:** Coat color does NOT affect meat quality (all taste identical), but affects live animal value (white deer command 50-100 gp vs common 20-30 gp).

---

### Size and Build

**ADULT MALE (Buck):**
- **Live Weight:** 120-200 lbs (avg 160 lbs, variable due to breeding/feeding)
- **Estate Deer:** 150-200 lbs (grain-fed, larger)
- **Wild Deer:** 120-160 lbs (browse-fed, smaller)
- **Shoulder Height:** 34-38 inches
- **Body Length:** 60-70 inches

**ADULT FEMALE (Doe):**
- **Live Weight:** 90-150 lbs (avg 120 lbs)
- **Shoulder Height:** 30-34 inches
- **Body Length:** 55-65 inches

**COMPARISON TO WHITETAIL:**
| Metric | Whitetail | Fallow (Wild) | Fallow (Estate) | Fallow Difference |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Male Weight | 150 lbs | 140 lbs | 175 lbs | -7% (wild), +17% (estate) |
| Female Weight | 110 lbs | 105 lbs | 130 lbs | -5% (wild), +18% (estate) |
| Retail Yield | 52 lbs | 48 lbs | 60 lbs | -8% (wild), +15% (estate) |

**ESTATE ADVANTAGE:** Grain supplementation (2-3 lbs per deer per day during winter) increases body weight 15-25% over wild deer.

---

### Antler Characteristics (Palmation)

**PALMATED TIPS (Diagnostic Feature):**

Fallow deer bucks develop **palmated antlers** (flattened, shovel-like blades) unlike any other Western Faerûn cervine:

**STRUCTURE:**
- **Main Beam:** Rises from pedicle, curves backward
- **Brow Tine:** First tine (points forward, 4-8 inches)
- **Trez Tine:** Second tine (points upward, 6-10 inches)
- **Palmation:** Top of antler flattens into shovel/hand shape (palm)
- **Points:** Edges of palm develop multiple points (6-14 total points per antler)

**AGE-BASED DEVELOPMENT:**
- **1.5 years (Yearling):** Spikes OR small forks (4-6 inches, no palmation)
- **2.5 years:** 6-8 points, beginning palm development (2-3 inch palm width)
- **3.5 years:** 8-10 points, moderate palm (4-6 inch width)
- **4.5+ years (Mature):** 10-14 points, full palm (6-10 inch width)
- **Trophy (5-7 years):** 12-16 points, massive palm (8-12 inch width)

**ANTLER MEASUREMENTS:**
- **Length:** 20-28 inches (main beam)
- **Spread:** 18-26 inches (inside spread)
- **Palm Width:** 4-12 inches (varies by age/quality)
- **Palm Thickness:** 5-10 mm (thick, heavy)

**GROWTH CYCLE (Same as Whitetail):**
- **Ches-Tarsakh:** Shedding
- **Mirtul-Flamerule:** Velvet growth
- **Flamerule-Eleasis:** Peak velvet
- **Eleasis:** Velvet stripping
- **Eleint-Alturiak:** Hardened

---

**ANTLER VALUE:**
- **8-Point (Young):** 20-35 sp (small palm, decorative)
- **10-Point (Mature):** 35-60 sp (moderate palm, quality trophy)
- **12-14 Point (Trophy):** 60-100 sp (large palm, premium)
- **Estate Record Bucks:** 100-200 sp (exceptional palm, 10+ inch width, symmetry)
- **Velvet Antlers:** 10-25 gp/lb (2-4 lbs per mature buck = 20-100 gp total)

**MARKET PREFERENCE:** Palmated antlers are **highly decorative** (unique appearance, tavern mounts, estate halls). They command **20-40% premium** over similar-sized whitetail antlers.

---

## IV. BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES (Wild vs Estate)

### Wild Fallow Deer Behavior

**WARINESS:** Moderate (less wary than whitetail, but more cautious than estate deer)
- **Flight Distance:** 80-120 yards (vs whitetail 100-150 yards, fallow slightly more tolerant)
- **Habitat:** Dense forest edges (prefer woodland/meadow transition zones)

**SOCIAL STRUCTURE:**
- **Herds:** 5-15 individuals (does + fawns, bucks separate except rut)
- **Feeding:** Dawn/dusk (crepuscular, similar to whitetail)

**HUNTING DIFFICULTY:** Moderate (easier than whitetail, harder than estate deer)

---

### Estate Fallow Deer Behavior

**DOCILITY:** High (habituated to humans, tolerate close approach)
- **Flight Distance:** 30-60 yards (vs wild fallow 80-120 yards, 50-75% reduction)
- **Feeding:** Opportunistic (grain feeders, accept hand-feeding in some parks)
- **Interaction:** Tolerate estate workers, carriages, visitors (accustomed to activity)

**MANAGED FEEDING:**
- **Summer:** Natural browse (grass, forbs, leaves)
- **Winter:** Grain supplement (oats, barley, 2-3 lbs per deer per day)
- **Result:** Consistent body condition (8-10% body fat year-round vs wild 4-8% seasonal variation)

**HUNTING DIFFICULTY:** Very Low (approach to 30-50 yards routine, almost domestic)

**ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:**
- **"Park Hunts" Criticism:** Some hunters view estate deer as "too easy" (not sporting)
- **Noble Defense:** Estates argue managed populations = sustainable, reliable meat (conservation benefit)
- **Market Reality:** Customers don't care (meat quality/availability matter, not hunt difficulty)

---

## V. SEASONAL BIOLOGY (Harptos Calendar)

### Annual Cycle (Similar to Whitetail)

**SPRING (Ches-Mirtul):**
- **Ches-Tarsakh:** Antler shedding (bucks), late pregnancy (does)
- **Mirtul:** Fawning (1-2 fawns, avg 1.5 for wild, 1.8 for estate due to better nutrition)

**SUMMER (Kythorn-Eleasis):**
- **Kythorn-Flamerule:** Fawn rearing, antler velvet growth
- **Eleasis:** Velvet stripping, fawns weaning

**FALL (Eleint-Uktar) - HUNTING SEASON & RUT:**
- **Eleint:** Pre-rut fattening (best meat quality)
- **Marpenoth:** RUT SEASON (bucks aggressive, poor meat quality)
- **Uktar:** Post-rut (bucks emaciated if wild, less severe if estate grain-fed)

**WINTER (Nightal-Alturiak):**
- **Estate Deer:** Good condition (grain supplementation, 6-8% body fat maintained)
- **Wild Deer:** Poor condition (browse only, 2-4% body fat, 15-20% weight loss)

**SEASONAL ADVANTAGE (Estate Deer):**
- Wild deer quality varies 40-50% (Eleint prime vs Alturiak poor)
- Estate deer quality varies only 15-20% (managed feeding buffers seasonal stress)
- **Result:** Estate deer offer **year-round consistent meat quality** (valuable for commercial buyers)

---

### Rut Season (Marpenoth)

**RUT BEHAVIOR (Same Timing as Whitetail):**
- **Lekking (Unique to Fallow):** Bucks gather in small groups (3-8 males), defend territories, vocalize (groaning calls)
- **Vocalizations:** Deep groaning/belching sounds (attract does, intimidate rivals)
- **Fighting:** Antler clashing (palmated antlers lock, pushing matches)
- **Meat Quality Impact:** Same as whitetail (bucks POOR, does GOOD)

**PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION:** Harvest does OR pre-rut bucks (early Marpenoth). Estate managers often cull rut bucks for population control (meat suitable for grinding/sausage only).

---

## VI. FIELD HARVESTING AND PROCESSING

### Hunting Access

**WILD DEER:**
- **Permits Required:** 6-12 sp (Neverwinter Wood, Ardeep Forest jurisdictions)
- **Difficulty:** Moderate (easier than whitetail, docile temperament)
- **Transport:** 1-3 days to markets (Neverwinter, Waterdeep)

**ESTATE DEER:**
- **Landowner Permission REQUIRED:** Trespassing = 200-500 gp fine + jail
- **Paid Hunts:** Some estates offer guided hunts (50-150 gp per hunter, includes deer + processing)
- **Estate Sales:** Nobles sell surplus deer to butchers (15-30 gp per deer, live OR field-dressed)
- **Transport:** 0-1 day (estates near cities, easy access)

---

### Field Dressing and Yield

**PROCEDURE:** Identical to whitetail (see § 02_SWORD_COAST_WHITETAIL: Field Dressing).

**YIELD CALCULATION (160 lb Fallow Deer, Estate-Raised):**

**STEP 1: Live to Dressed (65%)**
- Live Weight: 160 lbs
- Dressing %: 65% (same as whitetail)
- Dressed Weight: 160 × 65% = **104 lbs**

**STEP 2: Dressed to Retail (45%)**
- Dressed Weight: 104 lbs
- Retail %: 45% (same as whitetail)
- Retail Weight: 104 × 45% = **46-47 lbs**

**FINAL TOTAL YIELD:** 29% (160 lbs live → 47 lbs retail)

**COMPARISON (160 lb Fallow vs 150 lb Whitetail):**
| Metric | Whitetail (150 lb) | Fallow (160 lb) | Difference |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Live Weight | 150 lbs | 160 lbs | +10 lbs (+7%) |
| Dressed | 98 lbs | 104 lbs | +6 lbs (+6%) |
| Retail | 44 lbs | 47 lbs | +3 lbs (+7%) |

**ESTATE ADVANTAGE:** Estate fallow (175 lbs) yields 60 lbs retail (36% more than wild fallow 47 lbs).

---

### Butcher Shop Processing

**PROCESSING IDENTICAL TO WHITETAIL** (see § 02_SWORD_COAST_WHITETAIL: Butcher Shop Processing).

**THE 7 PRIMALS (104 lb Dressed Fallow):**
| Primal | Weight | % of Dressed |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Shoulders (2) | 32-38 lbs | 31-37% |
| Hams (2) | 48-60 lbs | 46-58% |
| Backstraps (2) | 4-5 lbs | 4-5% |
| Tenderloins (2) | 1-1.5 lbs | 1-1.5% |
| Ribs | 8-10 lbs | 8-10% |
| Neck | 6-8 lbs | 6-8% |
| Shanks (4) | 8-10 lbs | 8-10% |

**AGING:**
- **Minimum:** 7-10 days (wild deer, similar to whitetail)
- **Standard:** 10-12 days (estate deer, slightly more tender due to grain feeding)
- **Temperature:** 34-38°F
- **Humidity:** 70-75%

**PROCESSING TIME:** 5-7 hours (vs whitetail 6-8 hours, fallow slightly faster due to more even muscling from grain feeding).

**LABOR COST:** 20-28 sp (vs whitetail 24-32 sp).

---

## VII. PRICING AND ECONOMICS

### Retail Pricing (Estate vs Wild)

**ESTATE FALLOW DEER (60% of Market):**

**PREMIUM CUTS:**
- **Backstrap Steaks:** 8-12 sp/lb (vs whitetail 10-14 sp/lb, LOWER due to consistent supply)
- **Tenderloin:** 12-16 sp/lb (vs whitetail 14-18 sp/lb)

1. **Consistent Supply:** Estate herds = year-round availability (no seasonal scarcity premiums)
2. **Managed Population:** Predictable harvest (nobles cull surplus, stable market prices)
3. **Volume Sales:** Estates sell bulk (10-20 deer at once, volume discounts)
4. **Less "Wild" Appeal:** Some customers view estate deer as "less authentic" (prefer wild whitetail)

---

**WILD FALLOW DEER (40% of Market):**

**PREMIUM CUTS:**
- **Backstrap Steaks:** 10-14 sp/lb (same as whitetail, "wild game" premium)
- **Tenderloin:** 14-18 sp/lb (same as whitetail)
- **Rib Chops:** 8-12 sp/lb (same as whitetail)

**STANDARD CUTS:**
- **Ham Steaks:** 5-8 sp/lb (same as whitetail)
- **Shoulder Roasts:** 4-6 sp/lb (same as whitetail)
- **Ground Venison:** 4-6 sp/lb (same as whitetail)

**WILD PREMIUM:** Wild fallow commands **same prices** as whitetail (similar flavor, size, quality).

---

### Whole Deer Value

**ESTATE FALLOW (175 lbs, Grain-Fed, 10-Point Buck):**

**MEAT VALUE (60 lbs Retail):**
- **Premium Cuts (12 lbs):** Backstraps (5 lbs @ 10 sp) + Tenderloins (1.5 lbs @ 14 sp) + Rib Chops (5.5 lbs @ 9 sp) = 50 + 21 + 50 = **121 sp**
- **Standard Cuts (38 lbs):** Ham Steaks (24 lbs @ 5 sp) + Shoulder Roasts (14 lbs @ 4 sp) = 120 + 56 = **176 sp**
- **Economy/Ground (10 lbs):** 10 lbs @ 4 sp = **40 sp**
- **SUBTOTAL MEAT:** 337 sp = **33.7 gp**

**BYPRODUCT VALUE:**
- Hide: 2.5 gp = 25 sp (spotted hide premium, +25% vs plain brown)
- Antlers (10-point palmated): 45 sp
- Heart/Liver: 20 sp
- Bones: 1.5 sp
- **SUBTOTAL BYPRODUCTS:** 91.5 sp = **9.15 gp**

**TOTAL GROSS VALUE:** 33.7 + 9.15 = **42.85 gp**

**COSTS:**
- Processing: 5-7 hours @ 4 sp/hour = 20-28 sp = **2-2.8 gp**
- Packaging: 1.5-2 gp
- **TOTAL COSTS:** **3.5-4.8 gp**

**NET VALUE:** 42.85 - 3.5 to 4.8 = **38.05-39.35 gp**

**COMPARISON TO WHITETAIL (180 lb, 41 gp total):**
- Fallow (Estate, 175 lbs): **42.85 gp** (+4.5% value, similar size)
- Slightly higher due to larger size (grain-fed estate deer) + spotted hide premium

---

**WILD FALLOW (140 lbs, Browse-Fed, 8-Point Buck):**

**NET VALUE:** ~32-34 gp (10-15% less than estate fallow due to smaller size, lower yield)

---

## VIII. CULINARY APPLICATIONS

### Meat Quality Profile

**TASTE:**
- **Estate Deer:** Mild, slightly sweet (grain influence, minimal gamey notes, closest to domestic venison)
- **Wild Deer:** Moderate gamey flavor (browse-fed, similar to whitetail, more pronounced than estate)

**TEXTURE:**
- **Estate Deer:** Tender (grain feeding = faster muscle development, finer grain, less connective tissue)
- **Wild Deer:** Standard cervine (requires aging, similar to whitetail)

**FAT CONTENT:**
- **Estate Deer:** 6-8% body fat year-round (grain supplementation, more marbling than wild deer)
- **Wild Deer:** 4-8% seasonal (2-3% winter, 6-8% fall, standard for wild cervines)

**COLOR:**
- **Dark Red:** Similar to whitetail (lean game meat, myoglobin-rich)

---

### Cooking Techniques

**ALL WHITETAIL TECHNIQUES APPLY** (see § 02_SWORD_COAST_WHITETAIL: Culinary Applications).

**ESTATE DEER ADVANTAGES:**
- **More Forgiving:** Higher fat content = less likely to dry out (can cook to medium 135-140°F vs whitetail rare/medium-rare 125-135°F)
- **Milder Flavor:** Suitable for customers who dislike strong game flavor (introduce wild game gradually)
- **Consistent Results:** Predictable meat quality (institutional kitchens, taverns value consistency)

---

### Recipe: Tavern Special - Fallow Deer Pie

**WHY FALLOW DEER FOR PIES:**
- **Consistent Supply:** Estate deer available year-round (taverns need reliable ingredients)
- **Affordable:** Estate fallow cheaper than wild whitetail (3-5 sp/lb ground vs 4-6 sp/lb)
- **Mild Flavor:** Broad appeal (customers who avoid "gamey" meat accept fallow pie)

**INGREDIENTS (Serves 8-10):**
- Fallow deer shoulder (ground), 3 lbs (12-15 sp cost)
- Onions (2 large, diced)
- Carrots (3, diced)
- Potatoes (4, cubed)
- Ale (1 pint, dark)
- Beef stock (2 cups)
- Flour (for roux + pie crust)
- Butter (4 oz)
- Herbs (thyme, rosemary, bay leaf)
- Salt, pepper

**METHOD:**
1. **Brown Meat:** Cook ground fallow in large pot (break up, 10 minutes)
2. **Add Vegetables:** Onions, carrots (sauté 5 minutes)
3. **Deglaze:** Add ale (scrape bottom, 2 minutes)
4. **Simmer:** Add stock, potatoes, herbs (simmer 45 minutes, covered)
5. **Thicken:** Make roux (flour + butter), stir into stew (thicken gravy)
6. **Assemble:** Pour into pie dish, top with crust
7. **Bake:** 375°F, 30-35 minutes (golden crust)

**COST PER PIE:**
- Ingredients: 25-30 sp (meat 12-15 sp, vegetables/flour/butter 10-12 sp, ale 3 sp)
- Labor: 2 hours (prep + cooking) = 8 sp
- **TOTAL COST:** 33-38 sp (3.3-3.8 gp)

**TAVERN SELLING PRICE:**
- 8-10 servings @ 8-12 sp per serving = 64-120 sp (6.4-12 gp)
- **PROFIT:** 2.6-8.2 gp per pie (70-220% markup)

**TAVERN BUSINESS CASE:** Fallow deer pies are **highly profitable** (low ingredient cost, high volume sales, popular dish). Many taverns serve "venison pie" using estate fallow exclusively.

---

## IX. ESTATE MANAGEMENT

### Park Population Management

**SUSTAINABLE HARVEST FORMULA:**

Estate managers maintain stable populations by culling surplus annually:

**EXAMPLE: 100-Deer Park (Waterdeep Noble Estate)**

**ANNUAL CYCLE:**
- **Spring Fawning:** 40 does × 1.8 fawns/doe × 80% survival = 58 fawns born
- **Population Growth:** 100 adults + 58 fawns = 158 total
- **Sustainable Harvest:** 58 deer culled (returns population to 100)

**HARVEST COMPOSITION:**
- **Young Bucks (1.5-2.5 years):** 20-25 deer (meat quality good, antlers small)
- **Old Bucks (6+ years):** 3-5 deer (antlers past prime, meat for grinding)
- **Does (Surplus):** 25-30 deer (best meat quality, population control)
- **Culls (Injured/Sick):** 5-8 deer (removed for herd health)

**REVENUE:**
- **Live Sales:** 10-15 deer @ 20-30 gp = 200-450 gp (sold to other estates, breeders)
- **Meat Sales:** 40-45 deer @ 30-40 gp = 1,200-1,800 gp (sold to butchers, processed for estate kitchen)
- **Trophy Bucks:** 3-5 deer @ 50-80 gp = 150-400 gp (antlers alone, meat extra)
- **TOTAL REVENUE:** 1,550-2,650 gp per year

**COSTS:**
- **Winter Grain:** 100 deer × 90 days × 2.5 lbs/day × 1 cp/lb = 225 gp
- **Fencing Maintenance:** 50-100 gp per year
- **Labor (Gamekeeper):** 200-400 gp per year (full-time employee)
- **TOTAL COSTS:** 475-725 gp per year

**NET PROFIT:** 1,075-1,925 gp per year (managed deer park profitable + aesthetic landscaping + hunting entertainment)

**END OF NEVERWINTER FALLOW DEER FILE**

*Fallow deer represent the "semi-domesticated commercial" niche - spotted coats, palmated antlers, dual populations (wild 40% vs estate 60%), year-round consistent supply from managed herds, 20-30% cheaper than wild whitetail, primary market = taverns/institutions/budget-conscious households seeking reliable affordable venison.*
