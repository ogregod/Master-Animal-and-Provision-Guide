## I. BREED OVERVIEW

### The Magical Exception

Moonlit deer are **NOT normal cervines**. They are **fey-touched magical creatures** that occasionally cross from the Feywild into the Prime Material Plane. Where whitetail/elk/moose are mundane animals, moonlit deer possess **innate magical properties**.

**KEY CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Glowing Antlers:** Emit soft silver-blue light (both sexes, visible 50-100 yards in darkness)
- **Magical Resistance:** Advantage on saves vs magic (CR 1/4 despite small 100-150 lb size)
- **Alchemical Value:** Antlers/organs worth 50-500 gp (vs whitetail antlers 15-40 sp)
- **Fey Connection:** Disappear when killed (50% chance, return to Feywild as spirit)
- **Small Size:** 100-150 lbs (same as roe deer, but magical = dangerous)
- **Protected Status:** ILLEGAL to hunt in Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Silver Marches (10-50 gp fines, confiscation, jail)
- **Limited Availability:** Feywild crossings only (Ardeep Forest, Neverwinter Wood, High Forest fey portals)

**MARKET POSITION:** Moonlit deer occupy the **"magical contraband"** niche:
- **Illegal = Black Market:** 90% of sales underground (wizards, alchemists, collectors)
- **Astronomical Prices:** 200-800 gp per deer (vs whitetail 35-41 gp, **5-20x more valuable**)
- **Extreme Risk:** Poaching penalties 50-200 gp fines + 10-30 days jail + equipment confiscation
- **Alchemical Demand:** Glowing antlers = potion ingredients (darkvision, invisibility, fey step)

**WARNING:** This guide documents moonlit deer for **educational purposes** and **legal harvests** (licensed researchers, fey crossroads permits). **DO NOT POACH** - penalties are severe.

## II. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

### Feywild Crossings (Rare, Temporary)

**PRIMARY CROSSINGS:**

**ARDEEP FOREST (Most Frequent):**
- **Frequency:** 2-4 times per year (Midsummer, Highharvestide, fey holidays)
- **Duration:** 1-7 days (portal open, moonlit deer visible on Prime Material)
- **Population:** 5-20 individuals per crossing

**NEVERWINTER WOOD (Moderate):**
- **Frequency:** 1-3 times per year
- **Duration:** 1-5 days
- **Population:** 3-15 individuals

**HIGH FOREST (Rare):**
- **Frequency:** 1-2 times per year (deep forest, remote locations)
- **Duration:** 1-3 days
- **Population:** 2-10 individuals

**TOTAL PRIME MATERIAL POPULATION:** 10-45 individuals at any given time (EXTREMELY RARE, fluctuates wildly).

**FEY ORIGIN (Feywild Homeland):**
- **Population:** Unknown (Feywild herds estimated 1,000-5,000 individuals, but inaccessible)
- **Habitat:** Fey forests, moonlit glades (high magic concentration)

---

### Legal Status and Permits

**ILLEGAL JURISDICTIONS (90% of Western Faerûn):**
- **Waterdeep:** ILLEGAL (50-200 gp fine, 10-30 days jail, equipment confiscation)
- **Neverwinter:** ILLEGAL (30-100 gp fine, confiscation)
- **Silver Marches:** ILLEGAL (religious protection, Mielikki worshipers consider sacred)
- **Baldur's Gate:** ILLEGAL (recent law, pressure from Waterdeep)

**LEGAL/GRAY AREAS:**
- **Amn:** LEGAL with permit (100-300 gp permit, limited issue, 1-3 per year for whole nation)
- **Luskan:** LEGAL (no regulations, but moonlit deer rarely appear there)
- **Thay:** LEGAL (Red Wizards prize fey components, black market destination)

**RESEARCH PERMITS (Waterdeep):**
- **Cost:** 200-500 gp (academic institutions, wizards' guilds only)
- **Requirements:** Detailed research proposal, guild sponsorship, government approval
- **Quota:** 1-2 moonlit deer per year (for entire city of Waterdeep)
- **Purpose:** Alchemical study, magical research (NOT commercial sale)

**PRACTICAL REALITY:** Legal moonlit deer harvests = 5-10 per year (entire Western Faerûn). Black market = 20-50 per year (estimated, poaching).

---

## III. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### Size and Build

**ADULT MALE (Stag):**
- **Live Weight:** 100-150 lbs (avg 125 lbs, **same as roe deer, 17% smaller than whitetail**)
- **Shoulder Height:** 28-32 inches
- **Body Length:** 45-55 inches
- **Build:** Delicate, slender (ethereal appearance, graceful)

**ADULT FEMALE (Doe):**
- **Live Weight:** 80-120 lbs (avg 100 lbs)
- **Shoulder Height:** 26-30 inches
- **Body Length:** 42-52 inches

**SIZE COMPARISON:**
| Metric | Roe Deer | Moonlit Deer | Whitetail |
|--------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Weight | 60 lbs | 125 lbs | 150 lbs |
| Height | 26 inches | 30 inches | 38 inches |
| Retail Yield | 18 lbs | 40 lbs | 52 lbs |

**MAGICAL BUILD:** Despite small size, moonlit deer are **CR 1/4** (magical resistance, fey teleportation, dangerous if threatened).

---

### Glowing Antlers (Diagnostic Feature)

**BOTH SEXES ANTLERED (Like Caribou, Unlike Most Deer):**
- **Stags:** Larger antlers (6-10 points, 12-18 inches tall)
- **Does:** Smaller antlers (4-6 points, 8-12 inches tall)
- **Glow:** Constant soft silver-blue light (moonlight quality, visible 50-100 yards in darkness)
- **Brightness:** Equivalent to candle (does NOT blind, provides dim light 10 ft radius)

**ANTLER STRUCTURE:**
- **Form:** Graceful curves (flowing, artistic, unlike mundane deer angular racks)
- **Material:** Hardened bone infused with fey magic (glows even after death, if harvested)
- **Shedding:** Ches-Tarsakh (same timing as mundane deer, but shed antlers STOP glowing within 1-7 days)

**GLOW MECHANICS:**
- **Source:** Fey magic (innate to living moonlit deer, tied to life force)
- **Duration After Death:** 1-30 days (varies by individual, fades gradually)
- **Preservation:** Alchemical process required (see § Alchemical Value below)

---

### Coat and Coloration

**SUMMER COAT:**
- **Body:** Silver-gray to pale white (ethereal, shimmers in moonlight)
- **Underparts:** Pure white (belly, throat)
- **Dappled Pattern:** Faint silver spots (star-like, visible only in bright light)

**WINTER COAT:**
- **Body:** Bright white to snow-white (camouflage in snow, but glow defeats purpose)
- **Ethereal Quality:** Coat appears to shimmer (light refraction, magical property)

**EYES:**
- **Color:** Bright silver OR pale blue (reflective, glow faintly in darkness)
- **Night Vision:** Superior to mundane deer (darkvision 60 ft, can see in complete darkness)

---

## IV. MAGICAL PROPERTIES

### Fey Teleportation (Danger to Hunters)

**MISTY STEP ABILITY:**
- **Frequency:** 1-3 times per day (when threatened, moonlit deer can teleport 30 ft as bonus action)
- **Mechanics:** Disappear in puff of silver mist, reappear up to 30 ft away (line of sight OR familiar location)
- **Use Case:** Escape from hunters (deer sees hunter, teleports behind tree OR across river, flees)

**HUNTING CHALLENGE:**
- **First Shot Critical:** Wounded moonlit deer teleport away (tracking impossible, lose deer)
- **Professional Guidance:** Heavy crossbow OR overwhelming magic (kill in single hit OR control with magic)

---

### Return to Feywild Upon Death (50% Chance)

**BODY DISAPPEARANCE:**
- **Trigger:** When moonlit deer dies (natural death, killed by hunters, disease)
- **Effect:** 50% chance body disappears in 1d10 minutes (returns to Feywild as spirit, corporeal form dissolves)
- **Result:** Hunter loses ALL material (meat, antlers, hide vanish with body)

**MITIGATION:**
- **Immediate Processing:** Field dress + remove antlers within 10 minutes of death (before disappearance possible)
- **Magic Circle:** Trap body in magic circle (prevents teleportation, requires spellcaster)
- **Cold Iron Stakes:** Pin body to ground with cold iron (disrupts fey magic, prevents return)

**PROFESSIONAL REALITY:** Black market poachers use **cold iron stakes** (15-30 gp per set, reusable). Legal researchers debate ethics of preventing natural spirit return.

---

### Magical Resistance

**ADVANTAGE ON SAVES:**
- **Spell Resistance:** Moonlit deer have advantage on all saving throws vs spells and magical effects
- **Result:** Sleep, Hold Person, Charm spells OFTEN FAIL (50-75% resistance rate vs 25% for mundane deer)

**CHALLENGE RATING 1/4:**
- **Small Size = Normally CR 0:** 100-150 lbs deer would be CR 0 if mundane (like roe deer)
- **Magical Abilities = CR 1/4:** Teleportation + magic resistance + disappearance = dangerous quarry

---

## V. ALCHEMICAL AND MAGICAL VALUE

### Glowing Antlers (Primary Value)

**ALCHEMICAL USES:**
- **Darkvision Potions:** Ground antler powder (key ingredient, 20-40 gp value per dose)
- **Invisibility Potions:** Antler tips (contributes to fey-touched invisibility, 50-80 gp value)
- **Fey Step Scrolls:** Whole antler (anchors teleportation magic, 80-120 gp value)
- **Moonbeam Wands:** Antler as wand core (channel moonlight, 100-200 gp value)

**ANTLER VALUE (MASSIVE):**
- **Stag Antlers (6-8 points, glowing):** 80-200 gp (vs mundane whitetail 15-40 sp, **40-100x more valuable**)
- **Stag Antlers (10-point, exceptional):** 200-400 gp
- **Doe Antlers (4-6 points):** 40-100 gp (smaller, but still magical)
- **Matched Pair (Stag):** 150-350 gp (symmetry important for alchemical processing)

**GLOW PRESERVATION (Critical for Value):**
- **Problem:** Antlers fade 1-30 days after death (lose magical glow, alchemical value drops 80-90%)
- **Solution:** Alchemical stasis (see below)

**ALCHEMICAL STASIS PROCESS:**
1. **Immediate Harvest:** Remove antlers within 1 hour of death (faster = better preservation)
2. **Moonwater Bath:** Submerge antlers in moonwater (water blessed under full moon, 5-10 gp per gallon)
3. **Seal:** Place in lead-lined box (blocks magical decay, 20-40 gp per box)
4. **Storage:** Keep in cool, dark location (cellar, vault)
5. **Duration:** Preserved indefinitely (glow maintained, alchemical properties stable)

**PRESERVATION COST:** 25-50 gp (moonwater, lead box, labor). **Essential** to maintain value.

---

### Organs and Blood

**HEART:**
- **Weight:** 0.4-0.6 lbs (small, but magically potent)
- **Use:** Love potions, charm spells (fey connection enhances emotion magic)
- **Value:** 30-60 gp (vs mundane deer heart 5-10 sp, **60-120x more**)

**LIVER:**
- **Weight:** 1-1.5 lbs
- **Use:** Purification potions, poison antidotes (fey resilience)
- **Value:** 20-40 gp

**BLOOD:**
- **Volume:** 3-5 pints (must be collected during field dressing, spoils quickly)
- **Use:** Ink for magical scrolls (fey-touched ink holds enchantments better)
- **Value:** 15-30 gp per pint (45-150 gp total)

**EYES:**
- **Use:** Scrying foci (see through fey mists, detect invisible creatures)
- **Value:** 25-50 gp per pair

**TOTAL ALCHEMICAL VALUE (Organs/Blood):** 135-330 gp (vs mundane deer organs 15-30 sp, **90-220x more**).

## VI. BUTCHER SHOP PROCESSING

### Yield Calculation (125 lb Moonlit Deer Stag)

**STEP 1: Live to Dressed (60%)**
- Live Weight: 125 lbs
- Dressing %: 60% (**LOWER than mundane deer 65%** due to delicate build, less muscle mass)
- Dressed Weight: 125 × 60% = **75 lbs**

**STEP 2: Dressed to Retail (50%)**
- Dressed Weight: 75 lbs
- Retail %: 50% (**HIGHER than mundane deer 45%** due to fine bones, less waste)
- Retail Weight: 75 × 50% = **37-38 lbs**

**FINAL TOTAL YIELD:** 30% (125 lbs live → 38 lbs retail, vs mundane deer 29%).

**SMALL YIELD:** Moonlit deer provide **minimal meat** (38 lbs vs whitetail 52 lbs, roe deer 18 lbs). Meat is **NOT the primary value** - alchemical components are.

---

### Meat Quality (Secondary Value)

**TASTE:**
- **Delicate, Sweet:** Similar to roe deer, but with faint floral notes (fey influence)
- **No Gamey Flavor:** Completely mild (fey magic purifies meat, removes wild notes)

**TEXTURE:**
- **Fine Grain:** Smallest muscle fibers (even finer than roe deer)
- **Naturally Tender:** Minimal aging required (3-5 days vs mundane deer 7-14 days)

**MAGICAL PROPERTY:**
- **Faint Glow (First 24 Hours):** Meat glows faintly silver-blue for 1 day after death (fades, becomes normal meat)
- **Enhanced Nutrition:** Consuming moonlit deer meat grants advantage on next Constitution save (within 24 hours, fey vitality)

**MEAT VALUE (If Sold):**
- **Backstrap:** 15-25 sp/lb (vs mundane roe deer 12-18 sp/lb, +25-40% premium)
- **Ham Steaks:** 10-15 sp/lb (vs roe deer 8-12 sp/lb)
- **Total Meat Value:** 38 lbs × 12 sp avg = 456 sp = **45.6 gp**

**REALITY:** Most poachers **do NOT sell meat** (too risky, alchemical components worth 10x more, meat is discarded OR consumed personally to avoid evidence).

---

## VII. PRICING AND ECONOMICS

### Black Market Value (Illegal Sales)

**WHOLE MOONLIT DEER VALUE (125 lb Stag, 8-Point, Successfully Harvested & Preserved):**

**ALCHEMICAL COMPONENTS:**
- **Antlers (8-point, preserved):** 120-220 gp
- **Heart:** 40-55 gp
- **Liver:** 25-35 gp
- **Blood (4 pints):** 60-120 gp
- **Eyes:** 30-45 gp
- **SUBTOTAL ALCHEMICAL:** 275-475 gp

**MEAT (If Sold, Risky):**
- **38 lbs retail:** 45.6 gp (usually discarded to avoid evidence)

**HIDE:**
- **Shimmering Silver Hide:** 15-30 gp (decorative, magical aura, small size limits utility)

**TOTAL GROSS VALUE (Alchemical Only):** 275-475 gp (vs mundane whitetail 41 gp, **7-12x more valuable**).

**COSTS:**
- **Poaching Risk:** No expedition cost (hunt near civilization, Ardeep Forest = 1-2 days from Waterdeep)
- **Processing:** 1.5-2.5 gp (butchering, careful organ preservation)
- **Preservation:** 25-50 gp (moonwater, lead box, alchemical stasis for antlers)
- **Black Market Broker:** 50-100 gp (fencer fee, 20-25% of sale value, connects to wizards/alchemists)
- **TOTAL COSTS:** 76.5-152.5 gp

**NET VALUE (Black Market Sale):** 275-475 - 76.5-152.5 = **198.5-398.5 gp per deer**

**RISK-ADJUSTED VALUE:**
- **Capture Risk:** 30-50% chance (Waterdeep guards patrol Ardeep during known crossing times)
- **If Caught:** -50-200 gp fine, -10-30 days jail, -equipment confiscation (50-150 gp), -possible criminal record
- **Expected Value:** 198.5-398.5 × 50-70% success = **99.25-279 gp per attempt**
- **Expected Loss (If Caught):** -100-350 gp (fines + equipment + lost income from jail)

**RESULT:** Moonlit deer poaching is **high-risk, high-reward**. Successful poachers earn 200-400 gp per deer (10x whitetail), but caught poachers lose 100-350 gp + criminal record.

---

### Legal Market (Research Permits)

**ACADEMIC/RESEARCH VALUE:**
- **Permit Cost:** 200-500 gp (upfront, sunk cost)
- **Quota:** 1 deer (cannot sell components, research use only)
- **Purpose:** Study fey magic, develop potions, publish papers

**LEGAL SALES (Permitted Byproducts):**
- Some jurisdictions allow **surplus material sales** (if research extracts needed sample, can sell remainder)
- **Value:** 50-150 gp (partial deer, components already partially consumed for research)

**ECONOMIC REALITY:** Legal research permits are **NOT profitable** (200-500 gp cost for 50-150 gp potential return). Pursued for **academic knowledge**, not profit.

---

## VIII. HUNTING TECHNIQUES (Illegal Poaching Methods)

**DISCLAIMER:** This section documents methods for **educational purposes** and **anti-poaching enforcement**. **DO NOT POACH.**

### Crossing Time Prediction

**POACHERS TRACK FEY CALENDAR:**
- **Midsummer (Kythorn 20):** Highest probability crossing (80-90% chance in Ardeep)
- **Highharvestide (Eleint 21):** Moderate probability (50-70%)
- **Midwinter (Nightal 20):** Low probability (20-40%, harsh weather)

**PATROL RESPONSE:** Waterdeep Guard increases Ardeep patrols during Midsummer (expects poachers, sets up checkpoints on roads leading from forest).

---

### Capture Methods

**METHOD 1: Ambush at Portal (Most Common):**
- **Setup:** Locate fey crossing (shimmering air, silver mist, moonlit deer visible)
- **Wait:** Moonlit deer cross from Feywild to Prime Material (disoriented for 1-10 minutes)
- **Strike:** Heavy crossbow, single shot (kill instantly OR deer teleports away)

**METHOD 2: Cold Iron Trap:**
- **Bait:** Silver bells (fey creatures attracted to musical chimes)
- **Trap:** Cold iron snare (disrupts fey magic, prevents teleportation)
- **Risk:** Illegal possession of cold iron traps (10-30 gp fine if caught with trap, even if no deer captured)

**METHOD 3: Magic (Wizards Only):**
- **Hold Person:** Paralyze deer (but magic resistance = 50-75% failure rate)
- **Sleep:** Enchant deer to sleep (same high failure rate)
- **Magic Circle:** Trap deer in circle (prevents teleportation, allows safe approach)
- **Professional:** Wizard-poachers rare but effective (combine magic + crossbow)

---

## IX. CONSERVATION AND ETHICS

### Why Moonlit Deer Are Protected

**ECOLOGICAL:**
- **Extremely Rare:** 10-45 individuals on Prime Material at any time (vs whitetail 15,000-25,000)
- **Slow Reproduction:** Fey deer breed slowly (1 fawn every 2-3 years vs mundane deer 1-2 per year)
- **Fey Balance:** Moonlit deer maintain balance between Feywild and Prime Material (spiritual/magical role)

**CULTURAL:**
- **Mielikki Worship:** Goddess of forests considers moonlit deer sacred (killing one = offense to deity, clerics seek justice)
- **Fey Alliances:** Some fey courts consider moonlit deer under protection (poaching = insult to fey, potential diplomatic incident)

**ECONOMIC:**
- **Sustainable Alternative:** If protected, moonlit deer populations could grow (potentially legal, regulated harvest in future = more sustainable profit than poaching)
