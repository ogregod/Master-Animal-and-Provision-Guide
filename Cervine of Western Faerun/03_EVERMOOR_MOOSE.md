## I. BREED OVERVIEW

### The Apex Common Cervine

Moose represent the **absolute largest** cervine accessible to hunters before entering monster/giant beast territory (giant elk CR 2). At 900-1,400 lbs, they dwarf even wapiti elk (750 lbs) and approach the size of draft horses.

**KEY CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Massive Size:** 900-1,400 lbs bulls (1.2-1.9x wapiti, 6-9x whitetail)
- **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS:** CR 1/2 (bulls WILL attack unprovoked, can kill experienced hunters)
- **Remote Habitat:** Evermoor Way (10-20 day expeditions, most inaccessible cervine)
- **Enormous Yield:** 300-450 lbs retail (1.4-2x wapiti, 7-10x whitetail)
- **Palmated Antlers:** 6-8 ft spread (flat shovel-like, unlike elk/deer)
- **Solitary:** Not herding (vs elk herds, moose alone or mother+calf only)
- **Expedition Costs:** 100-300 gp (double wapiti costs, longest duration, most dangerous)
- **Gross Value:** 340-380 gp (meat 180-220 gp + antlers 50-120 gp + hide 15-25 gp)
- **Professional Hunters Only:** Too dangerous for amateurs (40-60% of moose hunters are professionals)

**MARKET POSITION:** Moose occupy the **"extreme expedition trophy"** niche. This is **NOT a meat hunt** - it's a **challenge hunt**:
- **Prestige:** Successfully hunting moose = peak hunting achievement (short of giant elk)
- **Danger:** Real risk of death (CR 1/2 = can kill armed hunters)
- **Investment:** 100-300 gp before seeing a moose
- **Commitment:** 10-20 days away from civilization
- **Return:** 200-250 gp net (if successful), but 30-50% failure rate

**WHO HUNTS MOOSE:**
- **Wealthy Trophy Hunters:** Nobles seeking ultimate challenge (prestige > profit)
- **Professional Hunters:** Make living selling meat/antlers (business investment)
- **Adventuring Parties:** Experienced groups with combat skills (treat as dangerous monster)
- **Almost NEVER:** Casual hunters, families, first-time big game hunters (suicidal)

## II. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

### Primary Range (Evermoor Way - Swamp/Moor Wilderness)

**EVERMOOR WAY (Core Habitat):**
- **Central Evermoor:** 1,500-2,500 individuals (deepest swamps, most inaccessible)
- **Northern Evermoor:** 1,000-1,800 individuals (transitions to tundra, sparse forest)
- **Southern Evermoor:** 800-1,500 individuals (overlap with wapiti at edges)
- **Elevation:** 500-2,500 ft (low moors, swamps, marshy valleys, scattered forest)
- **Total Evermoor:** 3,300-5,800 individuals

**ACCESS CHALLENGES:**
- **Distance from Waterdeep:** 18-25 days round trip (400-500 miles, extremely remote)
- **Terrain:** Swamps, bogs, moors (difficult footing, cart roads non-existent, even pack animals struggle)
- **Seasonal Access:** Eleint-Uktar ONLY (summer = mosquitoes/disease, winter = frozen swamps impassable)
- **Expedition Base:** Nesme (closest settlement, 8-12 days to Evermoor interior)

---

### Secondary Range (Scattered Northern Populations)

**SPINE OF THE WORLD (Northern Valleys):**
- **Low Valleys:** 600-1,200 individuals (isolated, Icewind Dale borderlands)
- **Elevation:** 1,000-3,000 ft
- **Access:** Luskan OR Icewind Dale = 10-18 days

**HIGH MOOR (Western Edges):**
- **Overlap Zone:** 200-400 individuals (mixed with wapiti, transitional habitat)
- **Access:** High Moor expeditions encounter moose rarely (10-15% of elk hunts)

**TOTAL MOOSE POPULATION (Western Faerûn):** 4,100-7,400 individuals (RAREST common cervine)

---

## III. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### Massive Size

**ADULT MALE (Bull):**
- **Live Weight:** 900-1,400 lbs (avg 1,200 lbs, **1.6x wapiti, 8x whitetail**)
- **Trophy Bulls:** 1,300-1,600 lbs (10-15 years old, exceptional)
- **Record Bulls:** 1,600-1,800 lbs (rare, ancient, remote populations)
- **Shoulder Height:** 66-78 inches (5.5-6.5 ft, **taller than most horses**)
- **Body Length:** 110-130 inches (9-11 ft)
- **Build:** Massively muscular, humped shoulders (distinctive profile)

**ADULT FEMALE (Cow):**
- **Live Weight:** 700-1,000 lbs (avg 850 lbs, **1.5x wapiti cow, 7.5x whitetail doe**)
- **Shoulder Height:** 60-72 inches (5-6 ft)
- **Body Length:** 100-120 inches (8-10 ft)
- **Build:** Lighter than bulls, but still massive (larger than most male deer/elk)

**SEXUAL DIMORPHISM:** Bulls are 40-50% heavier than cows (more extreme than elk 35-40%, similar to caribou 40-50%).

**SIZE COMPARISON TABLE:**
| Metric | Wapiti Bull | Moose Bull | Difference |
|--------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Weight | 750 lbs | 1,200 lbs | +450 lbs (+60%) |
| Height | 57 inches | 72 inches | +15 inches (+26%) |
| Retail Yield | 220 lbs | 408 lbs | +188 lbs (+85%) |
| Antler Spread | 36-50 inches | 60-90 inches | +24-40 inches (+67-80%) |
| CR | 1/4 | 1/2 | DOUBLE danger |

**VISUAL SCALE:** A mature moose bull is **taller at the shoulder than a human is tall** (6-6.5 ft). Standing next to one is intimidating - they are **enormous**.

---

### Distinctive Features

**BODY PROPORTIONS (Unique Among Cervines):**
- **Humped Shoulders:** Pronounced shoulder hump (muscular, gives downward-sloping back profile)
- **Long Legs:** Extremely long (allows wading in deep swamps 4-5 ft deep)
- **Short Body:** Relatively short torso (vs elk/deer longer bodies)
- **Result:** Moose look "tall and gangly" (vs elk/deer "athletic")

**HEAD:**
- **Large, Overhanging Muzzle:** Drooping nose (pendulous upper lip, distinctive profile)
- **Bell (Dewlap):** Hanging skin/hair under throat (6-18 inches long, bulls larger than cows)
- **Function:** Bell purpose debated (scent dispersal? Sexual display? Thermoregulation?)

**COAT:**
- **Summer:** Dark brown to reddish-brown (short hair, 10-20 mm)
- **Winter:** Black-brown to nearly black (thick hair 40-60 mm, dense undercoat)
- **Legs:** Lighter gray-tan to cream (stockings, contrasts with dark body)

**IDENTIFYING FEATURES (No Mistaking for Other Cervines):**
- **Massive Size:** Dwarfs elk/deer (6+ ft shoulder height)
- **Humped Shoulders:** Diagnostic (elk/deer lack shoulder hump)
- **Bell:** Hanging throat skin (elk/deer never have this)
- **Palmated Antlers:** Flat shovel-like (elk have branching, deer have single beam OR small palms)

---

### Antler Characteristics (PALMATED GIANTS)

**STRUCTURE (Most Distinctive of All Cervines):**

Moose antlers are **palmated** (flattened into shovel/hand shapes with finger-like points along edges), unlike elk (branching) or whitetail (single beam).

**TYPICAL MATURE BULL (10-14 points, 8-12 years):**
- **Main Beam:** Short, thick (12-20 inches from skull to palm)
- **Palm:** Large flat shovel (20-35 inches wide, 25-45 inches long)
- **Points:** 8-18 finger-like projections along palm edge
- **Brow Palms (Optional):** Small palms near base (not all bulls have these, adds 2-4 points)
- **Spread:** 60-90 inches (5-7.5 ft, **wider than bull is tall**)
- **Total Points:** 10-14 typical (8-12 on main palms, 0-4 on brow palms)

**AGE-BASED DEVELOPMENT:**
- **2.5 years (Yearling):** Spikes OR small forks (10-16 inches, no palmation)
- **3.5 years:** 6-8 points, beginning palm development (4-8 inch palm width)
- **4.5 years:** 8-10 points, moderate palms (12-18 inch palm width)
- **5-7 years:** 10-12 points, large palms (20-30 inch palm width)
- **8-12 years (Mature):** 12-14 points, full palms (28-40 inch palm width, **PRIME TROPHY**)
- **13+ years (Monarch):** 14-18 points, massive palms (35-50 inch palm width, rare)

**ANTLER MEASUREMENTS:**
- **Palm Width:** 20-45 inches (widest part of shovel)
- **Palm Length:** 25-50 inches (base to top of palm)
- **Inside Spread:** 60-90 inches (5-7.5 ft, measured palm to palm)
- **Circumference (Base):** 10-14 inches (massively thick)
- **Mass (Weight):** 12-25 lbs per antler (vs wapiti 8-15 lbs, whitetail 1-2 lbs, **HEAVIEST**)

**GROWTH CYCLE (Same Timing):**
- **Ches-Tarsakh:** Shedding (massive antlers fall, 12-25 lbs × 2 = 24-50 lbs dropped)
- **Mirtul-Flamerule:** Velvet growth (4-6 inches per week, enormous nutrient demand)
- **Flamerule-Eleasis:** Peak velvet (10-20 lbs velvet per bull, alchemical value 100-400 gp)
- **Eleasis:** Velvet stripping (bulls thrash bushes, small trees, velvet hangs in bloody ribbons)
- **Eleint-Alturiak:** Hardened antlers (dark staining from mud/bark)
- **Ches:** Shedding begins anew

---

**ANTLER VALUE (Hardened, Trophy Scoring):**

**TYPICAL 12-14 POINT BULL (Mature, 8-12 years):**
- **Good 12-Point:** 500-900 sp (60-70 inch spread, moderate palms)
- **Quality 12-14 Point:** 900-1,500 sp (70-80 inch spread, large palms, good symmetry)
- **Trophy 14-Point:** 1,500-2,500 sp (80-90 inch spread, massive palms, excellent symmetry)

**EXCEPTIONAL BULLS:**
- **16-Point (Rare):** 2,500-4,000 sp (extra brow palms, wide spread)
- **Record Class (18+ points, 90+ inch spread):** 4,000-8,000 sp (museum quality, once-in-lifetime)

**VELVET ANTLERS (Alchemical Harvest):**
- **Mature Bull (10-20 lbs velvet):** 30-50 gp/lb = 300-1,000 gp total
- **Live Harvest:** IMPOSSIBLE (sedating 1,200 lb aggressive bull = death sentence)
- **Fresh Kill Harvest:** Flamerule-Eleasis (extremely limited permits, 200-500 gp cost)

**MARKET DYNAMICS:**
- **Antlers = 30-50% of total bull value** (50-120 gp antlers vs 180-220 gp meat)
- **Palmated Premium:** Moose antlers command 50-80% premium over similar-weight elk (unique shape, rarer)
- **Trophy Prestige:** Moose mounts = ultimate hunting trophy (short of giant elk/magical beasts)

---

## IV. BEHAVIORAL CHARACTERISTICS (DANGEROUS)

### Solitary Nature

**NON-HERDING:**
- Moose do NOT form herds (vs elk herds 10-100 individuals)
- **Bulls:** Solitary 10-11 months per year (only gather near cows during rut Marpenoth)
- **Cows:** Solitary OR with calf only (mothers fiercely protective, see below)
- **Result:** Hunting moose = finding lone individuals in vast wilderness (harder than elk herd hunting)

---

### Aggression Levels (CR 1/2 DANGER)

**MOOSE ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS COMMON CERVINE:**

**COWS WITH CALVES (Kythorn-Uktar):**
- **Maternal Aggression:** Cows with calves WILL attack if approached within 100 yards
- **Attack Behavior:** Charge, stomp with front hooves (crushing blows), trample
- **Fatality Risk:** Documented deaths (hunters crushed, trampled, internal injuries fatal)
- **Professional Guidance:** **"NEVER approach cow with calf. If you see calf, LEAVE IMMEDIATELY."**

**BULLS DURING RUT (Marpenoth):**
- **Unprovoked Aggression:** Bulls attack perceived threats WITHOUT warning (vs elk bugle first)
- **Charge Distance:** Bulls charge anything within 50-150 yards (perceived as rivals/threats)
- **Attack Method:** Lower head, charge at 35 mph, gore with antlers OR stomp
- **Antler Danger:** 60-90 inch spread = massive weapons (can impale, toss hunters 10-15 ft)
- **Fatality Risk:** **VERY HIGH** (20-30% of hunters killed by moose are killed during rut)

**WOUNDED MOOSE (Any Season):**
- **Do NOT Track Alone:** Wounded moose often double back, ambush trackers
- **Wait 30-60 Minutes:** Let moose lie down, bleed out (tracking immediately = charge risk)
- **Follow Blood Trail Cautiously:** Firearm ready, expect charge from thick cover

**PROFESSIONAL STATISTICS:**
- **Moose Attack Rate:** 5-10% of moose hunts involve charge/attack (vs elk <1%)
- **Hunter Injury Rate:** 2-4% of moose hunters injured per year (gore wounds, broken bones, trampling)
- **Hunter Fatality Rate:** 0.3-0.8% (vs elk 0.1%, whitetail <0.01%, moose **8-10x more deadly**)

**RESULT:** Moose hunting requires **combat mindset**, not just hunting skill:
- **Firearm Backup:** Heavy crossbow mandatory (light crossbow often insufficient to stop charge)
- **Group Hunting:** 2-3 hunters minimum (one engages, others provide covering fire if charge)
- **Escape Route:** Always identify retreat path before approaching (thick swamp vegetation limits movement)

---

### Rut Season (Marpenoth) - EXTREME DANGER

**RUT TIMING:** Marpenoth (same as elk), but **moose rut is shorter, more intense, and MORE DANGEROUS**:

**BULL BEHAVIOR:**

**Vocalization:**
- **Grunting:** Deep, guttural grunts (vs elk bugling, moose don't bugle)
- **Frequency:** Sporadic (vs elk constant, moose more silent/unpredictable)

**Wallowing:**
- **Behavior:** Bulls dig huge wallows (10-15 ft diameter, 2-3 ft deep)
- **Urination:** Saturate wallow, roll (coat entire body in mud/urine)
- **Scent:** Overpowering (worse than elk, detectable 200+ yards)

**Aggression:**
- **Attacks on Humans:** Bulls attack WITHOUT provocation (perceive all movement as rival bulls)
- **Attacks on Animals:** Bulls attack horses, mules, even bears (documented cases)
- **No Warning:** Bulls charge silently OR with short grunt (vs elk bugle warning)

**Fighting:**
- **Intensity:** Brutal (antler-locking, goring, trampling, fatal injuries common)
- **Fatalities:** 5-10% of mature bulls die from rut injuries (vs elk 1-3%, moose **3-10x deadlier to each other**)

**MEAT QUALITY IMPACT (Same as Elk):**
- **Rut Bulls:** EXTREME gamey flavor (testosterone + wallowing + urine = nearly inedible)
- **Professional Standard:** **"Rut bull moose = jerky/sausage only, add 60-70% pork fat + smoke heavily"**

**OPTIMAL HARVEST STRATEGIES:**

**Trophy Hunters (Antlers Priority):**
- **Target:** Early rut bulls (early Marpenoth), antlers hardened but bulls not yet insane
- **Risk:** Accept CR 1/2 danger (firearm backup mandatory, group hunting required)
- **Meat:** Accept poor quality (plan for grinding)

**Meat Hunters (Quality Priority):**
- **Target:** Cows (Eleint-early Marpenoth) OR young bulls (2-4 years, pre-prime)
- **Risk:** Cows SAFER than rut bulls (but still CR 1/2 if with calf)
- **Meat:** Excellent quality (8-12% body fat, mild flavor for moose)

**PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION:** **"Do NOT hunt trophy moose bulls alone. CR 1/2 is REAL. Bring 2-3 experienced hunters, heavy weapons, plan for charge."**

---

## V. EXPEDITION HUNTING LOGISTICS

### Pre-Expedition Planning

**TIMING:**
- **Best Season:** Eleint (pre-rut, bulls/cows fattened, weather stable, swamps accessible)
- **Trophy Season:** Early Marpenoth (rut begins, antlers hardened, **EXTREME DANGER**)
- **Avoid:** Late Marpenoth-Alturiak (peak rut too dangerous, winter swamps freeze)

**PERMITS:**
- **Evermoor Moose Tag (Waterdeep/Nesme Jurisdiction):** 30-80 sp per hunter (very limited, lottery, 15-30% draw rate)
- **Trophy Bull Tag (12-point minimum):** 100-200 sp (extremely limited, <10% draw rate)
- **Cow Tag:** 15-40 sp (more available, population management)

**EXPEDITION GROUP SIZE:**
- **Solo:** **ABSOLUTELY NOT** (suicide, moose will kill you)
- **2 Hunters:** **NOT RECOMMENDED** (minimum for safety, but risky if moose charges)
- **3-5 Hunters:** **REQUIRED MINIMUM** (can cover each other, handle charge, process carcass)
- **6-10 Hunters:** Large commercial expedition (outfitter-led, 5-10 moose, expensive)

---

### Expedition Costs (4-Hunter Group, 15-Day Hunt)

**TRANSPORTATION:**
- **Pack Animals (Mules):** 10-14 mules @ 6 gp/mule/15 days = 60-84 gp (need extras for moose weight)
- **Guide (Expert):** 100-200 gp (MUST be experienced moose guide, knows Evermoor, combat-trained)
- **Pack Handlers (2):** 50-80 gp (manage large mule train)
- **Armed Escort (2):** 40-60 gp (backup if moose charges, wolves, bandits)

**PROVISIONS:**
- **Food (15 days, 4 hunters + 5 staff):** 30-50 gp
- **Camping Gear:** 20-35 gp (heavy-duty tents, swamp conditions)
- **Medical Supplies:** 10-20 gp (healing potions, bandages for gore injuries)

**EQUIPMENT:**
- **Weapons/Ammunition:** 15-30 gp (heavy crossbow bolts, backup weapons)
- **Butchering Tools (Heavy-Duty):** 8-15 gp (large saws, rope, block-and-tackle for quarters)

**CONTINGENCY:**
- **Emergency Fund:** 20-40 gp (injury evacuation, extended hunt, lost mules)

**TOTAL EXPEDITION COST (Per Group):**
- **Minimum:** 353 gp (bare-bones, risky)
- **Typical:** 500-700 gp (guided, provisioned, safe)
- **Luxury:** 900-1,500 gp (outfitter, guaranteed success, maximum safety)

**PER-HUNTER COST (4-Hunter Group):**
- **Shared Costs:** 125-175 gp per hunter (expedition divided 4 ways)
- **Individual Costs:** 30-80 sp (personal permit, personal gear)
- **TOTAL PER HUNTER:** 125-250 gp

**ECONOMIC REALITY:** Moose hunting is **DOUBLE the investment of elk** (125-250 gp vs elk 50-150 gp). This limits participation to:
- **Wealthy Nobles:** 250 gp = pocket change (seeking prestige, challenge, trophy)
- **Professional Hunters:** Business investment (sell meat/antlers for profit)
- **Adventuring Parties:** Experienced combatants (treat moose as CR 1/2 monster encounter)

---

## VI. FIELD HARVESTING (EXTREME CHALLENGES)

### Shot Placement

**VITAL ZONE:**
- **Size:** 20-24 inches diameter (large target, but...)
- **Challenge:** Massive chest depth (24-30 inches, vs elk 18-22 inches)
- **Penetration Required:** 20-30 inches (deep, requires heavy draw bow OR crossbow)

**PROFESSIONAL GUIDANCE:**
- **First Shot MUST Drop:** Wounded moose = charge (CR 1/2 danger)
- **Target Heart/Lungs:** Broadside ONLY (quartering shots fail on thick shoulder bones)
- **Heavy Crossbow Recommended:** Light crossbow often insufficient penetration

---

### Field Dressing (MASSIVE CARCASS)

**TIME REQUIRED:**
- **Experienced (3 people):** 60-90 minutes (1,200 lb bull, extremely heavy)
- **Solo:** **IMPOSSIBLE** (cannot roll/position 1,200 lb carcass alone)

**FIELD DRESSED WEIGHT:**
- **Live Weight:** 1,200 lbs
- **Dressing %:** 65%
- **Field Dressed:** 1,200 × 65% = **780 lbs** (vs wapiti 488 lbs, whitetail 117 lbs)

**CHALLENGES:**
- **Weight:** 780 lbs field-dressed = cannot move without quartering
- **Organs:** 90-120 lbs (heart 4 lbs, liver 15-20 lbs, intestines 70-90 lbs, VERY heavy)
- **Cooling:** Massive thermal mass (retains heat for hours, must prop open, priority cooling)

---

### Quartering (MANDATORY, Requires Block-and-Tackle)

**NO WHOLE-CARCASS TRANSPORT:** 1,200 lbs = impossible to transport whole. Quartering is universal, but **requires specialized equipment**.

**QUARTERING PROCEDURE:**

**1. SUSPEND CARCASS (Optional but Helpful):**
- **Block-and-Tackle:** Hoist carcass 2-3 ft off ground (easier cutting access)
- **Tree Limb:** Requires strong limb (8-10 inch diameter minimum, 15+ ft high)
- **Alternative:** Quarter on ground (messier, harder)

**2. REMOVE FRONT LEGS (SHOULDERS):**
- **Weight:** 90-130 lbs each (vs wapiti 60-85 lbs, **50% heavier**)
- **Challenge:** **EXTREMELY HEAVY**, requires 2-3 people to lift

**3. REMOVE HIND LEGS (HAMS):**
- **Weight:** 130-180 lbs each (vs wapiti 85-115 lbs, **53-56% heavier**)
- **Challenge:** **HEAVIEST QUARTERS**, 3 people required to maneuver safely

**4. REMOVE BACKSTRAPS:**
- **Weight:** 12-18 lbs each (24-36 lbs total)
- **Length:** 36-48 inches (massive)

**5. REMOVE TENDERLOINS:**
- **Weight:** 3-4 lbs each (6-8 lbs total)

**6. RIBS/NECK (Usually LEFT):**
- **Weight:** 50-70 lbs (ribs), 40-60 lbs (neck), too heavy/low-value to pack

**QUARTER WEIGHTS (1,200 lb Moose):**
- Front Quarters (2): 90-130 lbs each = 180-260 lbs total
- Hind Quarters (2): 130-180 lbs each = 260-360 lbs total
- Backstraps: 24-36 lbs
- Tenderloins: 6-8 lbs
- **PACKED TOTAL:** 470-664 lbs

**PACK ANIMAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **8-12 Mules (Standard):** Each carries 60-70 lbs (total capacity 480-840 lbs)
- **Note:** One moose = 8-12 mules (vs wapiti 5-7 mules, **70% more pack animals**)

**EXPEDITION LOGISTICS IMPACT:**
- **Must Bring Extra Mules:** Initial mule train (food, gear) + extra empty mules for meat
- **Cost Increase:** 10-14 mules × 6 gp = 60-84 gp (vs wapiti 5-7 mules × 5 gp = 25-35 gp)

---

## VII. BUTCHER SHOP PROCESSING

### Yield Calculation (1,200 lb Moose Bull)

**STEP 1: Live to Dressed (65%)**
- Live Weight: 1,200 lbs
- Dressing %: 65%
- Dressed Weight: 1,200 × 65% = **780 lbs**

**STEP 2: Dressed to Retail (45%)**
- Dressed Weight: 780 lbs
- Retail %: 45%
- Retail Weight: 780 × 45% = **351 lbs**

**FINAL TOTAL YIELD:** 29% (1,200 lbs live → 351 lbs retail)

**YIELD COMPARISON:**
| Cervine | Live | Dressed | Retail | Moose Advantage |
|---------|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Whitetail | 150 lbs | 98 lbs | 44 lbs | 8x more |
| Red Deer | 325 lbs | 211 lbs | 95 lbs | 3.7x more |
| Wapiti | 750 lbs | 488 lbs | 220 lbs | 1.6x more |
| **Moose** | **1,200 lbs** | **780 lbs** | **351 lbs** | **Baseline (largest)** |

**VALUE PROPOSITION:** One moose bull = **8x whitetail** OR **1.6x wapiti** in single harvest. This is **peak bulk venison** (short of giant elk).

---

### Primary Breakdown

**THE 7 PRIMALS (780 lb Dressed Moose):**
| Primal | Weight | % of Dressed |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Shoulders (2) | 235-280 lbs | 30-36% |
| Hams (2) | 350-430 lbs | 45-55% |
| Backstraps (2) | 24-36 lbs | 3-5% |
| Tenderloins (2) | 6-8 lbs | 1% |
| Ribs | 50-65 lbs | 6-8% |
| Neck | 40-55 lbs | 5-7% |
| Shanks (4) | 50-65 lbs | 6-8% |

**PROCESSING CHALLENGES:**

**EXTREME SIZE:**
- **Hind Quarters:** 175-215 lbs each (**HEAVIEST PRIMAL**, requires 3-4 butchers + overhead hoist)
- **Shoulders:** 120-140 lbs each (3 people minimum)
- **Specialized Equipment:** Industrial meat rails, heavy-duty saws (residential butcher shops often cannot process moose)

**PROCESSING TIME:**
- **Master Butcher (3-person team):** 18-24 hours (vs wapiti 12-16 hours, whitetail 6-8 hours)
- **Solo:** **IMPOSSIBLE** (physically cannot lift/maneuver quarters)

**LABOR COST:**
- **Time:** 18-24 hours (3-person team = 54-72 man-hours total)
- **Rate:** 4 sp/hour per person
- **Cost:** 216-288 sp = **21.6-28.8 gp** (vs wapiti 9.6-12.8 gp, whitetail 2.4-3.2 gp)

**PROFESSIONAL TIP:** Many butchers charge **flat rate for moose** (25-35 gp per moose regardless of time) due to extreme labor/equipment requirements.

---

### Aging (MAXIMUM Required)

**MOOSE REQUIRE LONGEST AGING OF ANY CERVINE:**

**Reasons:**
- **Largest Muscles:** Massive size = most connective tissue
- **Oldest Animals:** Trophy bulls 10-15 years (vs wapiti 6-10, whitetail 2-4)
- **Toughest Lifestyle:** Swamp/moor terrain, year-round cold (very dense muscle)

**AGING SCHEDULE:**
- **Minimum:** 18-21 days (vs wapiti 16-18, red deer 12-14, whitetail 7-10)
- **Standard:** 21-28 days (recommended for all but youngest cows)
- **Extended:** 28-35 days (trophy bulls 12+ years, maximum tenderness)
- **Temperature:** 34-38°F
- **Humidity:** 70-75%

**PROFESSIONAL WARNING:** "Moose under 21 days = boot leather. Customers WILL complain. MINIMUM 21 days or don't bother."

---

## IX. CULINARY APPLICATIONS

### Meat Quality

**TASTE:**
- **STRONGEST Cervine Flavor:** More pronounced than wapiti, MUCH stronger than whitetail
- **Comparison:** "Moose flavor = wapiti + 50% intensity" (very gamey, not for casual game meat eaters)
- **Rut Bulls:** EXTREME (inedible as steaks, heavy spicing required even for sausage)
- **Cows/Young Bulls:** Strong but acceptable (appeals to experienced wild game consumers only)

**TEXTURE:**
- **Coarsest Grain:** Largest muscle fibers (very noticeable texture)
- **Requires Maximum Aging:** 21-28 days (properly aged = tender, under-aged = inedible)

**WHO EATS MOOSE:**
- **Professional Hunters / Wilderness Dwellers:** Accustomed to strong game flavor
- **Institutional Buyers:** Taverns, military (heavy spicing masks flavor, bulk pricing attractive)
- **General Public:** Limited appeal (10-20% of population enjoys moose flavor, 80-90% prefer milder deer/elk)

---

### Cooking Techniques

**RECOMMENDED PREPARATIONS (Heavy Flavoring Required):**
- **Braising:** Long slow cooking (4-6 hours, red wine + juniper + heavy herbs masks gamey notes)
- **Smoking:** Ground moose + pork fat (60/40 ratio, heavy smoke = excellent sausage/jerky)
- **Stewing:** Cubed meat, long simmer (3-4 hours, ale + root vegetables balance flavor)
- **Avoid:** Rare steaks (gamey flavor overwhelming, only for extreme game meat enthusiasts)
