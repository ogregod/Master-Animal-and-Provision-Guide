## I. BREED OVERVIEW

### Comparison to Whitetail Baseline

The High Forest Mule Deer represents a **larger, stockier cousin** to the Sword Coast Whitetail. Where whitetails prefer dense lowland forests with thick undergrowth, mule deer thrive in **mountainous terrain** with mixed forest and open meadows.

**KEY DIFFERENCES FROM WHITETAIL:**
- **25-40% Heavier:** 150-250 lbs vs whitetail 120-180 lbs (more meat per animal)
- **Bifurcated Antlers:** Fork-style antlers (Y-shaped tines) vs whitetail single-beam
- **Bouncing Gait:** "Stotting" (all four legs together) vs whitetail sprinting
- **Larger Ears:** 8-10 inch ears (mule-like, hence name) vs whitetail 6-8 inch
- **Black Tail Tip:** Rope-like tail with black tip vs whitetail all-white tail
- **Higher Elevation:** 2,000-8,000 ft preference vs whitetail 0-2,000 ft

**PROCESSING SIMILARITY:** Despite size difference, mule deer use the **same yield formula** (65% dressing, 45% retail = 29% total) and the **same 7 primals** as whitetail. The techniques in § 02_SWORD_COAST_WHITETAIL apply directly - just scale for larger carcass.

## II. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

### Primary Range

**HIGH FOREST (Core Population):**
- **Eastern High Forest:** 4,000-7,000 individuals (Calling Horns to Olostin's Hold region)
- **Northern High Forest:** 3,000-5,500 individuals (approaching Silver Marches)
- **Foothills:** 2,500-4,000 individuals (transition zone to lowlands)
- **Elevation:** 2,000-6,000 ft (optimal habitat, mixed forest/meadow mosaic)

**GRAYPEAK MOUNTAINS (Secondary Range):**
- **Western Slopes:** 1,500-2,500 individuals (scattered populations)
- **Elevation:** 3,000-8,000 ft (higher than High Forest, sparser population)

**NETHER MOUNTAINS (Northern Range):**
- **Southern Faces:** 1,000-2,000 individuals (limited suitable habitat)
- **Elevation:** 2,500-7,000 ft

**TOTAL POPULATION:** 12,000-21,000 individuals (less abundant than whitetail, but locally common)

---

### Market Access and Logistics

**NEAREST MAJOR MARKETS:**
- **Loudwater:** 1-3 days from High Forest interior (primary market, closest access)
- **Secomber:** 2-4 days (Unicorn Run crossing, secondary market)
- **Everlund (Silver Marches):** 4-7 days (northern High Forest, long transport)
- **Waterdeep:** 6-10 days (distant, requires chilled wagon for fresh meat)

**ACCESS CHALLENGES:**
- **Mountain Terrain:** Requires pack animals (mules, mountain ponies) for 60% of range
- **No Cart Roads:** Most hunting areas inaccessible by wagon (quartering required)
- **Seasonal Closures:** High passes blocked Uktar-Tarsakh (winter snow, limits access)

**TRANSPORT COSTS:**
- **Local Sale (Loudwater):** 5-10 sp (1-2 day pack animal transport)
- **Regional (Waterdeep):** 5-15 gp per deer (chilled wagon, 6-10 days, group shipments)

**RESULT:** Mule deer are **more expensive** than whitetail due to transport costs (+20-30% premium), but **higher yield per animal** (60-75 lbs retail vs whitetail 52 lbs) makes them attractive for bulk buyers.

| Retail Yield | 52 lbs | 65 lbs | +13 lbs (+25%) |

---

### Distinctive Features

**EARS (Diagnostic Identifier):**
- **Size:** 8-10 inches long (vs whitetail 6-8 inches)
- **Proportion:** Mule-like (large relative to head, hence "mule deer" name)
- **Function:** Enhanced hearing (predator detection in open mountain terrain)

**TAIL:**
- **Length:** 5-9 inches (shorter than whitetail 10-11 inches)
- **Color:** Creamy white with black tip (rope-like, distinct from whitetail all-white)
- **Behavior:** NOT raised when fleeing (unlike whitetail flag, mule deer keep tail down)

**GAIT (Unique Locomotion):**
- **Stotting:** All four legs push off simultaneously (bouncing motion, 6-8 ft bounds)
- **Speed:** 40-45 mph (short bursts, vs whitetail 35-40 mph)
- **Terrain Advantage:** Stotting superior in rocky terrain (whitetail sprinting better on flat ground)

---

### Antler Characteristics

**BIFURCATED STRUCTURE (Key Difference from Whitetail):**

Mule deer antlers **fork into Y-shapes** (each tine splits into two), while whitetail antlers grow **single tines** off a main beam.

**ANTLER COMPARISON:**
| Feature | Whitetail | Mule Deer |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Structure | Single main beam + tines | Bifurcated (Y-forks) |
| Typical Points | 6-10 points | 8-12 points (4-6 per side) |
| Spread | 12-18 inches | 16-24 inches (**wider**) |
| Mass | Medium | Heavy (**thicker beams**) |

**TYPICAL MULE DEER RACK:**
- **Main Beam:** Forks into G1 and G2 (first fork)
- **G2 Fork:** Splits again (second fork, creating 2 more points)
- **Result:** 4 points per side from 2 forks (8-point typical)
- **Mature Bucks:** 10-12 points (additional forks on G3/G4)

**GROWTH CYCLE (Same Timing as Whitetail):**
- **Ches-Tarsakh:** Shedding (older bucks shed first)
- **Mirtul-Flamerule:** Velvet growth
- **Flamerule-Eleasis:** Peak velvet (alchemical harvest window)
- **Eleasis:** Velvet stripping
- **Eleint-Alturiak:** Hardened antlers

**ANTLER VALUE:**
- **8-Point (Typical):** 25-45 sp (wider spread than whitetail, more decorative)
- **10-Point (Quality):** 45-70 sp (heavy mass, symmetric forks)
- **12-Point (Trophy):** 70-120 sp (rare, thick beams, 20+ inch spread)
- **Velvet Antlers:** 12-30 gp/lb (3-5 lbs per mature buck = 36-150 gp total)

**MARKET PREFERENCE:** Mule deer antlers **command 20-30% premium** over whitetail due to distinctive fork pattern (more visually striking, preferred for tavern mounts, noble estates).

## IV. SEASONAL BIOLOGY (Harptos Calendar)

### Annual Cycle Overview

**SPRING (Ches-Mirtul):**
- **Ches:** Antler shedding (bucks), late pregnancy (does, 200-day gestation)
- **Tarsakh:** Migration to higher elevations (following snowmelt, fresh vegetation)
- **Mirtul:** Fawning (1-2 fawns, does seek seclusion in high meadows)

**SUMMER (Kythorn-Eleasis):**
- **Kythorn-Flamerule:** High elevation feeding (alpine meadows, 4,000-7,000 ft)
- **Flamerule-Eleasis:** Velvet antler growth (peak Flamerule)
- **Eleasis:** Velvet stripping, does nursing fawns

**FALL (Eleint-Uktar) - HUNTING SEASON:**
- **Eleint:** Migration to lower elevations (2,000-4,000 ft), pre-rut fattening
- **Marpenoth:** RUT SEASON (bucks aggressive, poor meat quality)
- **Uktar:** Post-rut, bucks emaciated

**WINTER (Nightal-Alturiak):**
- **Nightal-Alturiak:** Low elevation wintering (1,500-3,000 ft), survival mode
- **Condition:** Poor (15-20% body weight loss, minimal fat)

---

### Rut Season (Marpenoth)

**RUT TIMING:** Slightly earlier than whitetail (mid-Marpenoth peak vs late Marpenoth for whitetail).

**BUCK BEHAVIOR:**
- **Territoriality:** Bucks defend high-ground territories (ridges, rocky outcrops)
- **Fighting:** More intense than whitetail (headlong clashing, antler-locking, occasional injury)
- **Movement:** 300-500% increase in daily travel (seeking does in estrus)
- **Feeding:** 40-50% reduction (more extreme than whitetail 30-40%)

**MEAT QUALITY IMPACT (Same as Whitetail):**
- **Bucks:** POOR quality (gamey, lean, avoid except for grinding)
- **Does:** GOOD quality (stressed but acceptable)

**PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION:** Harvest does OR pre-rut bucks (early Marpenoth before rut peaks).

---

## V. FIELD HARVESTING

### Hunting Considerations

**TERRAIN CHALLENGES:**
- **Steep Slopes:** 30-60% grades common (pack animals required for retrieval)
- **Rock Fields:** Talus slopes (difficult footing, carcass dragging impossible)
- **Elevation:** 4,000-6,000 ft (thinner air, hunter fatigue factor)

**RETRIEVAL METHODS:**
- **Quartering (90% of Harvests):** Cut into 4 quarters + backstraps (pack on mules)
- **Whole Carcass (10%):** Only near cart roads (rare in mule deer range)

**FIELD DRESSING:** Identical to whitetail (see § 02_SWORD_COAST_WHITETAIL: Field Dressing).

**TIME REQUIRED:**
- **Field Dressing:** 20-35 minutes (200 lb mule deer, slightly longer than whitetail)
- **Quartering:** 30-45 minutes (if required for pack transport)

---

### Quartering for Pack Transport

**WHEN REQUIRED:** Nearly all High Forest mule deer hunts (cart access rare).

**QUARTERING PROCEDURE:**

**1. REMOVE FRONT LEGS (SHOULDERS):**
- Cut shoulder from rib cage (no bone, pure muscle attachment)
- **Weight:** 25-35 lbs each (heavier than whitetail 20-25 lbs)

**2. REMOVE HIND LEGS (HAMS):**
- Cut through hip joint OR disarticulate ball-and-socket
- **Weight:** 35-45 lbs each (heavier than whitetail 28-35 lbs)

**3. REMOVE BACKSTRAPS:**
- Cut along spine, peel from ribs
- **Weight:** 3-4 lbs each (6-8 lbs total)

**4. RIBS/NECK (Optional):**
- If pack capacity allows, take ribs (8-10 lbs) and neck (8-10 lbs)
- Often left in field (scavengers, lower value meat)

**QUARTER WEIGHTS (200 lb Mule Deer):**
- Front Quarters (2): 25-35 lbs each = 50-70 lbs total
- Hind Quarters (2): 35-45 lbs each = 70-90 lbs total
- Backstraps: 6-8 lbs
- **TOTAL PACKED:** 126-168 lbs (manageable for 2 mules, 60-80 lbs per mule)

## VI. BUTCHER SHOP PROCESSING

### Receiving and Yield Calculation

**EXAMPLE: 200 lb Mule Deer Buck (Pre-Rut, Prime Condition)**

**STEP 1: Live to Dressed (65%)**
- Live Weight: 200 lbs
- Dressing %: 65% (same as whitetail)
- Dressed Weight: 200 × 65% = **130 lbs**

**STEP 2: Dressed to Retail (45%)**
- Dressed Weight: 130 lbs
- Retail %: 45% of dressed (same as whitetail)
- Retail Weight: 130 × 45% = **58-59 lbs**

**FINAL TOTAL YIELD:** 29% (200 lbs live → 59 lbs retail)

**COMPARISON TO WHITETAIL (180 lb):**
| Metric | Whitetail (180 lb) | Mule Deer (200 lb) | Difference |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Live Weight | 180 lbs | 200 lbs | +20 lbs (+11%) |
| Dressed (65%) | 117 lbs | 130 lbs | +13 lbs (+11%) |
| Retail (45%) | 52 lbs | 59 lbs | +7 lbs (+13%) |

**CUSTOMER VALUE:** Mule deer yields **13% more retail meat** than whitetail, making them attractive for family bulk orders despite higher transport costs.

---

## VIII. CULINARY APPLICATIONS

### Meat Quality and Flavor

**TASTE PROFILE:**
- **Slightly Gamier than Whitetail:** Mountain browse (sage, juniper, bitterbrush) influences flavor
- **Richer Finish:** More pronounced "wild" notes (not unpleasant, just stronger)
- **Regional Variation:** High Forest deer (mixed forest) milder than Graypeak deer (alpine browse)

**TEXTURE:**
- **Slightly Tougher (Raw):** More active lifestyle (steep terrain climbing) = denser muscle
- **AGING CRITICAL:** 12-14 days minimum (vs whitetail 10-12 days)
- **Post-Aging:** Comparable to whitetail (tender when properly aged)

**COOKING RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- **All Whitetail Techniques Apply** (see § 02_SWORD_COAST_WHITETAIL: Culinary Applications)
- **Marinades Beneficial:** Strong marinades (red wine, juniper, rosemary) complement gamier flavor
- **Larger Portions:** Steaks/roasts 20-30% larger (adjust cooking times +15-20%)

---

### Specialty Recipe: High Forest Juniper-Crusted Backstrap

**INGREDIENTS:**
- Mule deer backstrap (2-3 lbs, whole strap)
- Juniper berries (2 Tbsp, crushed)
- Black peppercorns (1 Tbsp, crushed)
- Coarse salt (1 Tbsp)
- Olive oil (2 Tbsp)
- Butter (4 Tbsp)
- Fresh thyme (4 sprigs)

**METHOD:**
1. **Crust Mixture:** Combine crushed juniper, pepper, salt
2. **Coat Backstrap:** Rub oil on meat, press crust mixture into all sides
3. **Sear:** Hot cast iron, 2-3 minutes per side (4 sides total, browning crust)
4. **Roast:** 375°F oven, 20-25 minutes (to 130°F internal)
5. **Butter Baste:** Add butter + thyme to pan, tilt pan, spoon butter over meat (2 minutes)
6. **Rest:** 10 minutes, slice into 1-inch medallions

**FLAVOR NOTES:** Juniper echoes the mountain browse flavor (complementary, not masking), peppercorn adds heat, butter richness balances lean meat.

**SERVING:** Pairs with roasted root vegetables, wild mushrooms, red wine reduction.
