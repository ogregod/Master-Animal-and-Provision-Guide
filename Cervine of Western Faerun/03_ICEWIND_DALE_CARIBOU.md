---

## I. BREED OVERVIEW

### The Unique Migratory Cervine

Caribou occupy a **completely different niche** from all other cervines in this guide. While whitetail/elk/moose are **stationary** (year-round territories), caribou are **migratory** (travel 200-500 miles annually between tundra and forest).

**KEY CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Both Sexes Antlered:** ONLY cervine where cows grow antlers (bulls larger, but both sexes = antlers)
- **Migratory Herds:** 10,000-40,000 individuals per herd (vs elk herds 100-500, whitetail groups 5-20)
- **Migration Timing:** Eleint-Marpenoth southward (herds pass through Ten-Towns), Ches-Mirtul northward
- **Zero Expedition Cost:** Migration brings caribou TO hunters (vs elk 50-150 gp, moose 125-250 gp)
- **Cultural Significance:** Reghed Barbarian tribes = caribou-dependent (sacred animal, primary food source)
- **Moderate Size:** 280-450 lbs (smaller than wapiti 750 lbs, larger than red deer 325 lbs)
- **Moderate Yield:** 95-145 lbs retail (same as red deer, less than wapiti 220 lbs)
- **Preservation Focus:** Fresh meat = 20-30%, smoked/dried = 70-80% (winter survival requirement)

**MARKET POSITION:** Caribou occupy the **"migratory bulk harvest"** niche:
- **No Expedition:** Migration = free access (caribou come to you, zero travel costs)
- **Volume Harvest:** Can harvest 5-10 caribou in single day (vs elk 1 every 10-15 days)
- **Preservation Economy:** Most meat smoked/dried (long-term storage, Ten-Towns winter survival)
- **Cultural Constraints:** Reghed tribal quotas (respect hunting territories, avoid conflict with tribes)
- **Seasonal Window:** 4-8 week migration period (Eleint-Marpenoth, miss it = no caribou until next year)

---

## II. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

### Migratory Range (Icewind Dale Region)

**SUMMER RANGE (Kythorn-Eleasis):**
- **Reghed Glacier Tundra:** 20,000-40,000 individuals (massive herds, open tundra grazing)
- **Icewind Pass:** 5,000-10,000 individuals (mountain pass populations)
- **Northern Spine of the World:** 3,000-6,000 individuals (alpine meadows)
- **Total Summer:** 28,000-56,000 individuals (spread across 500+ miles of tundra)

**WINTER RANGE (Nightal-Mirtul):**
- **Southern Forests:** 20,000-40,000 individuals (dense conifer forests, 50-150 miles south of Ten-Towns)
- **Scattered Groups:** 8,000-16,000 individuals (some herds winter in sheltered valleys)
- **Total Winter:** 28,000-56,000 individuals (same total, different distribution)

**MIGRATION CORRIDORS (Eleint-Marpenoth, Ches-Mirtul):**
- **Ten-Towns Passage:** 15,000-30,000 individuals pass THROUGH Ten-Towns settlements (closest to civilization)
- **Eastern Route:** 8,000-15,000 individuals (bypass Ten-Towns, Reghed tribal territories)
- **Western Route:** 5,000-11,000 individuals (mountainous, difficult access)

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Caribou migration **passes directly through Ten-Towns** (Bryn Shander, Easthaven, Caer-Dineval, Caer-Konig). This means hunters can harvest caribou **WITHOUT wilderness expeditions** - the caribou come to them.

---

### Access and Harvest Timing

**NO EXPEDITION REQUIRED:**
- **Location:** Ten-Towns settlements (permanent structures, taverns, homes, civilization)
- **Travel:** 0 days (harvest from town, process in town, store in town)
- **Cost:** 0 gp (vs wapiti 50-150 gp, moose 125-250 gp)

**MIGRATION TIMING (Harptos Calendar):**
- **Fall Migration (Eleint-Marpenoth):** PRIMARY HARVEST SEASON
  - **Early Eleint:** Scout herds arrive (first 100-500 caribou, test timing)
  - **Mid-Eleint to Mid-Marpenoth:** Main herd passage (15,000-30,000 caribou, 4-6 week window)
  - **Late Marpenoth:** Stragglers, late calves (final 500-2,000 caribou)
- **Spring Migration (Ches-Mirtul):** SECONDARY HARVEST (smaller, post-winter lean animals)
  - **Late Ches:** Northbound return (faster migration, 2-3 weeks vs fall 4-6 weeks)
  - **Mirtul:** Pregnant cows (AVOID, conservation)

**OPTIMAL HARVEST WINDOW:** **Mid-Eleint to Early Marpenoth** (4 weeks, caribou fattened from summer grazing, before rut begins).

## III. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### Size and Build

**ADULT MALE (Bull):**
- **Live Weight:** 280-450 lbs (avg 365 lbs, **smaller than wapiti 750 lbs, similar to red deer 325 lbs**)
- **Shoulder Height:** 44-52 inches (vs wapiti 57 inches, whitetail 38 inches)
- **Body Length:** 75-90 inches
- **Build:** Compact, barrel-chested (adapted for cold, stocky proportions)

**ADULT FEMALE (Cow):**
- **Live Weight:** 200-350 lbs (avg 275 lbs, **larger than whitetail doe 110 lbs, smaller than wapiti cow 550 lbs**)
- **Shoulder Height:** 40-48 inches
- **Body Length:** 70-85 inches
- **Build:** Similar to bulls (less dimorphism than other cervines)

**SEXUAL DIMORPHISM:** Bulls are 30-35% heavier than cows (LOWEST dimorphism of large cervines, vs wapiti 35-40%, moose 40-50%).

---

### Unique Adaptations (Tundra Specialist)

**1. HOLLOW HAIR COAT:**
- **Structure:** Each hair is hollow (air-filled tube, unique to caribou/reindeer)
- **Function:** Extreme insulation (traps air, R-value superior to all other cervines)
- **Buoyancy:** Hollow hair = flotation (caribou excellent swimmers, cross rivers easily)
- **Challenge:** Hollow hair sheds profusely (processing = hair everywhere, cleaning difficult)

**2. BOTH SEXES ANTLERED (Unique Among Cervines):**
- **Bulls:** Large antlers (Ches-Tarsakh shedding)
- **Cows:** Smaller antlers (Mirtul-Kythorn shedding, LATER than bulls)
- **Function (Cows):** Dig through snow for lichen (cows keep antlers through winter, bulls shed early)
- **Result:** Winter herds = cows with antlers dominate (push bulls away from food sites)

**3. CLICKING TENDONS:**
- **Sound:** Audible clicking when walking (tendon snaps over ankle bone)
- **Function:** Herd location (caribou hear clicking 100+ yards, stay together in blizzards)
- **Hunting Cue:** Hunters hear approaching herd before seeing it (warning to prepare)

**4. BROAD HOOVES:**
- **Shape:** Wide, concave (snowshoe effect, 2-3x wider than elk hooves relative to body size)
- **Function:** Walk on snow (don't sink), swim (paddle-like), dig snow (for lichen)

---

### Coat Coloration

**SUMMER COAT (Kythorn-Eleasis):**
- **Body:** Dark brown to gray-brown
- **Neck:** Lighter cream to white mane (males more pronounced)
- **Face:** Light gray to white (especially around eyes, nose)
- **Legs:** White lower legs (stockings)

**WINTER COAT (Uktar-Mirtul):**
- **Body:** Light gray to nearly white (camouflage in snow)
- **Neck:** White to cream mane (very thick)
- **Face:** White (only dark eyes/nose visible)
- **Thickness:** 40-60 mm hair length (densest coat of any cervine, 2x thicker than moose)

**IDENTIFYING FEATURES:**
- **White Neck/Mane:** Diagnostic (no other cervine has white neck mane)
- **Stocky Build:** Barrel-chested, short-legged appearance (vs elk long-legged)
- **Clicking Sound:** Audible tendons (unique)

---

### Antler Characteristics

**BULL ANTLERS (UNIQUE STRUCTURE):**

Caribou antlers are **semi-palmated** (combination of elk branching + fallow/moose palmation):

**TYPICAL MATURE BULL (3-5 years):**
- **Main Beam:** Sweeping backward (28-40 inches along curve)
- **Bez Tine (Forward Shovel):** Flattened shovel overhanging face (DIAGNOSTIC, unique to caribou)
- **Rear Points:** 6-12 branching points on main beam (elk-style)
- **Top Palms (Optional):** Some bulls develop small palms at antler tops (moose-style)
- **Total Points:** 12-20 points (varies widely, asymmetry common)
- **Spread:** 30-45 inches (vs elk 36-50 inches, smaller)

**COW ANTLERS (Unique - NO Other Cervine):**
- **Structure:** Simple spikes OR small forks (6-14 inches tall)
- **Points:** 2-6 total (much smaller than bulls)
- **Function:** NOT display (snow digging, food competition with other cows)
- **Shedding:** Mirtul-Kythorn (AFTER calving, bulls shed Ches-Tarsakh)

**GROWTH CYCLE (Same Timing as Other Cervines):**
- **Ches-Tarsakh:** Bulls shed (cows KEEP antlers)
- **Mirtul-Flamerule:** Bulls regrow velvet
- **Flamerule-Eleasis:** Bulls peak velvet
- **Eleasis:** Bulls strip velvet
- **Eleint-Ches:** Bulls carry hardened antlers
- **Mirtul-Kythorn:** Cows shed (AFTER calving, post-winter survival period)

**ANTLER VALUE:**
- **Bull (12-16 points):** 40-80 sp (unique bez shovel, moderate size, decorative)
- **Bull (18-20 points, large):** 80-150 sp (rare, asymmetric often reduces value)
- **Cow (2-6 points):** 2-8 sp (minimal value, novelty only)
- **Matched Pair (Bull):** +30% bonus (symmetry rare in caribou)

**ANTLER MARKET:** Caribou antlers valued **30-50% below elk** of same weight (caribou = more common, less symmetrical, shorter main beams).

## IV. SEASONAL BIOLOGY AND MIGRATION

### Annual Cycle (Driven by Migration)

**SPRING (Ches-Mirtul) - Northward Migration:**
- **Late Ches:** Begin north migration (triggered by increasing daylight)
- **Tarsakh-Mirtul:** Travel 200-500 miles north (10-20 miles per day, herds together)
- **Mirtul:** Arrive tundra calving grounds (cows give birth, calves born on tundra)

**SUMMER (Kythorn-Eleasis) - Tundra Residence:**
- **Kythorn:** Calving (1 calf typical, born within 2-3 days of each other = synchronized)
- **Flamerule-Eleasis:** Tundra grazing (lichens, grasses, forbs, fattening for winter)

**FALL (Eleint-Uktar) - Southward Migration & Rut:**
- **Eleint:** Begin south migration (triggered by first frosts, shortening days)
- **Marpenoth:** RUT SEASON (during migration, bulls chase cows while moving south)
- **Uktar:** Arrive winter range (southern forests)

**WINTER (Nightal-Alturiak) - Forest Survival:**
- **Nightal-Alturiak:** Forest browsing (lichens on trees, digging through snow with hooves + antlers)
- **Condition:** Declining (10-20% body weight loss, harsh winter)

---

### Migration Mechanics

**WHY MIGRATE:**
- **Summer Tundra:** Abundant food (24-hour daylight, rapid plant growth), fewer predators (wolves avoid open tundra)
- **Winter Forest:** Shelter (wind protection, thermal cover), lichen (arboreal lichen on trees, accessible when dug from snow)

**HERD BEHAVIOR:**
- **Size:** 2,000-15,000 individuals per herd (subdivide into smaller groups 100-500 during migration)
- **Speed:** 10-20 miles per day (faster if predators/weather pressure, slower if feeding)
- **Route Fidelity:** Same migration routes used for generations (caribou follow trails, river crossings, passes)

**TEN-TOWNS PASSAGE:**
- **Timing:** Mid-Eleint to Mid-Marpenoth (4-6 weeks, staggered as subherds pass)
- **Route:** Through valleys between towns (Bryn Shander, Easthaven, Caer-Konig = major passages)
- **Hunting Opportunity:** Herds pass within 1-5 miles of settlements (walk to hunt, no expedition)

---

### Rut Season (Marpenoth, During Migration)

**RUT TIMING:** Marpenoth (same as whitetail/elk), but **occurs DURING migration** (unique stress factor):

**BULL BEHAVIOR:**
- **Chasing:** Bulls chase cows (while entire herd moving south 10-20 miles per day)
- **Fighting:** Less intense than elk/moose (bulls focused on movement, brief clashes only)
- **Vocalizations:** Grunting (not bugling like elk, softer sounds)
- **Feeding:** Reduced 20-30% (vs elk 40-50%, caribou can't afford to stop eating during migration)

**MEAT QUALITY IMPACT:**
- **Bulls:** MODERATE gamey (testosterone influence, but less extreme than elk/moose)
- **Cows:** GOOD (stress from migration, but still feeding actively)
- **Professional Standard:** Harvest bulls **early Marpenoth (pre-rut)** OR cows **entire season**

---

## V. CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE (Reghed Barbarian Tribes)

### Caribou as Sacred Animal

**REGHED DEPENDENCY:**
- **Primary Food Source:** 60-80% of Reghed diet = caribou meat (dried, smoked, pemmican)
- **Materials:** Hides (clothing, tents), antlers (tools, weapons), sinew (thread, bow strings), bones (needles, tools)
- **Cultural Identity:** Tribes named after totems (Tribe of the Elk, Tribe of the Bear, etc.), caribou = sacred

**REGHED HUNTING PRACTICES:**
- **Sustainable Harvest:** Take only what needed (vs Ten-Towns commercial harvest)
- **Respect Rituals:** Thank caribou spirit, use all parts (waste = offense to animal spirits)
- **Seasonal Taboos:** Do NOT hunt pregnant cows (Ches-Mirtul), do NOT hunt calves (Kythorn-Flamerule)

---

### Hunting Territory Conflicts

**REGHED CLAIMS:**
- **Eastern Migration Route:** Controlled by Reghed tribes (Ten-Towns hunters risk conflict if hunt here)
- **Traditional Grounds:** Specific valleys, river crossings = tribal territories (trespass = violence)

**TEN-TOWNS HUNTERS:**
- **Western Route:** Ten-Towns hunters use western passage (herds pass through/near settlements)
- **Respect Boundaries:** Do NOT cross into Reghed territories (avoid tribal conflict)
- **Trade Option:** Some Reghed tribes sell caribou meat to Ten-Towns (5-10 caribou @ 15-25 gp each)

**PROFESSIONAL GUIDANCE:**
- **Stay Near Ten-Towns:** Hunt herds passing through settlements (safe, legal, abundant)
- **Avoid Reghed Lands:** Do NOT venture east (risk ambush, theft, death)
- **Respect Quotas:** Ten-Towns councils set harvest limits (prevent over-hunting, maintain Reghed relations)

---

## VI. FIELD HARVESTING (Volume Processing)

### Hunting Strategy (Herd Culling)

**VOLUME HARVEST OPPORTUNITY:**

Unlike elk/moose (harvest 1 per 10-20 day expedition), caribou migration allows **multiple harvests per day**:

**EXAMPLE: 4-Hunter Group, Single Day:**
- **Morning:** Herd passes near town (2,000+ caribou, 2-hour passage)
- **Harvest:** Each hunter takes 2-3 caribou (8-12 total)
- **Field Dress:** 4 hunters × 3 hours each = 12 hours total labor
- **Result:** 8-12 caribou processed, 760-1,740 lbs retail meat (vs 1 elk = 220 lbs)

**CRITICAL WINDOW:** Migration lasts 4-6 weeks, but **peak harvest = 10-14 days** (main herd passage). Miss this window = wait until next year.

---

### Shot Placement and Field Dressing

**VITAL ZONE:** 12-16 inches diameter (similar to red deer, smaller than elk)

**FIELD DRESSING TIME:**
- **Experienced:** 20-35 minutes (365 lb caribou, similar to red deer 325 lbs)
- **Novice:** 35-50 minutes

**FIELD DRESSED WEIGHT:**
- **Live:** 365 lbs
- **Dressing %:** 65%
- **Dressed:** 365 × 65% = **237 lbs** (vs elk 488 lbs, whitetail 117 lbs)

**TRANSPORT:**
- **Whole Carcass:** Yes (237 lbs = manageable for 2 people with cart)
- **Quartering:** Optional (if processing in field, but most transport whole to town)
- **Distance:** 1-5 miles (herd to town, cart roads available near Ten-Towns)

---

### Volume Processing Logistics

**EXAMPLE: Hunter Harvests 5 Caribou in 4 Days**

**Day 1:** Harvest 2 caribou (morning herd passage)
- Field dress (2 × 30 minutes = 1 hour)
- Transport to town (cart, 2 hours)
- Begin smoking/drying (evening prep)

**Day 2:** Harvest 2 caribou (mid-day herd passage)
- Field dress (1 hour)
- Transport to town (2 hours)
- Continue smoking (check Day 1 meat)

**Day 3:** Harvest 1 caribou (late afternoon stragglers)
- Field dress (30 minutes)
- Transport (2 hours)

**Day 4:** Processing (no hunting, focus on preservation)
- Quarter all carcasses
- Salt/smoke meat (prepare for winter storage)

**Total:** 5 caribou = 475-725 lbs retail meat (vs 1 elk = 220 lbs from 10-15 day expedition)

---

## VII. BUTCHER SHOP PROCESSING

### Yield Calculation (365 lb Caribou Bull)

**STEP 1: Live to Dressed (65%)**
- Live Weight: 365 lbs
- Dressing %: 65%
- Dressed Weight: 365 × 65% = **237 lbs**

**STEP 2: Dressed to Retail (45%)**
- Dressed Weight: 237 lbs
- Retail %: 45%
- Retail Weight: 237 × 45% = **107 lbs**

**FINAL TOTAL YIELD:** 29% (365 lbs live → 107 lbs retail)

**COMPARISON TO OTHER CERVINES:**
| Cervine | Live | Retail | Caribou Comparison |
|---------|------|--------|--------------------|
| Red Deer | 325 lbs | 95 lbs | Caribou +13% |
| **Caribou** | **365 lbs** | **107 lbs** | **Baseline** |
| Wapiti | 750 lbs | 220 lbs | Wapiti +106% larger |

---

### Primary Breakdown

**THE 7 PRIMALS (237 lb Dressed Caribou):**
| Primal | Weight | % of Dressed |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Shoulders (2) | 70-85 lbs | 30-36% |
| Hams (2) | 107-135 lbs | 45-57% |
| Backstraps (2) | 10-14 lbs | 4-6% |
| Tenderloins (2) | 2-3 lbs | 1% |
| Ribs | 18-24 lbs | 8-10% |
| Neck | 14-18 lbs | 6-8% |
| Shanks (4) | 18-24 lbs | 8-10% |

**PROCESSING TIME:**
- **Journeyman:** 7-9 hours (similar to red deer, slightly longer due to hollow hair cleanup)
- **Labor Cost:** 28-36 sp = 2.8-3.6 gp

---

### Preservation Processing (PRIMARY FOCUS)

**FRESH MEAT (20-30% of Harvest):**
- **Use:** Immediate consumption (Ten-Towns taverns, households, 1-2 weeks refrigerated)
- **Cuts:** Steaks, roasts (premium cuts, fresh sales)

**SMOKED/DRIED MEAT (70-80% of Harvest):**

**WHY PRESERVATION FOCUS:**
- **Winter Survival:** Ten-Towns = isolated (no fresh meat supply Nightal-Mirtul, 5+ months)
- **Storage Necessity:** Caribou harvest = 4-6 week window (must preserve for year-long consumption)
- **Reghed Tradition:** Pemmican, smoked strips (traditional preservation, proven techniques)

**SMOKING PROCESS:**

**1. SLICE MEAT (Thin Strips):**
- **Thickness:** 1/4 inch (dries in 12-24 hours vs thick cuts 2-3 days)
- **Cuts Used:** Hams, shoulders (lean meat ideal, backstraps sold fresh)

**2. BRINE (Optional but Recommended):**
- **Solution:** Salt water (25% salt concentration, 2-4 hours)
- **Purpose:** Flavor, preservation (inhibits bacteria)

**3. SMOKE:**
- **Setup:** Smokehouse (enclosed shed, racks, fire pit)
- **Wood:** Conifer (pine, spruce, abundant in Icewind Dale, resinous smoke)
- **Temperature:** Low heat (80-120°F, "cold smoke" preserves without cooking)
- **Duration:** 12-24 hours (until dry, leathery, dark brown)

**4. STORAGE:**
- **Container:** Barrels, crates (layer with salt)
- **Location:** Cool dry place (cellars, outbuildings)
- **Shelf Life:** 6-12 months (if kept dry, prevents mold)

**SMOKED MEAT YIELD (365 lb Caribou):**
- **Fresh Meat Sold:** 20-30 lbs (steaks, roasts, 20-28% of retail)
- **Smoking:** 75-80 lbs (70-75% of retail)
- **Weight Loss (Smoking):** 40-50% (75 lbs raw → 40-45 lbs smoked)

---

## VIII. PRICING AND ECONOMICS

### Retail Pricing (Ten-Towns Market)

**FRESH MEAT:**
- **Backstrap Steaks:** 6-9 sp/lb (vs mainland whitetail 10-14 sp/lb, caribou LOWER due to abundance)
- **Ham Steaks:** 4-6 sp/lb
- **Shoulder Roasts:** 3-5 sp/lb
- **Ground:** 3-5 sp/lb

**SMOKED MEAT:**
- **Smoked Strips:** 8-12 sp/lb (HIGHER than fresh due to labor + preservation value)
- **Pemmican (Reghed Style):** 10-15 sp/lb (smoked meat + fat + berries, highest calorie density)

**PRICING DYNAMICS:**
- **Fresh = Abundant, Cheap:** 4-6 week harvest glut (supply overwhelms demand, prices drop 30-50%)
- **Smoked = Scarce, Expensive:** Winter scarcity (Nightal-Mirtul no fresh meat, smoked prices rise 50-100%)

---

### Whole Caribou Value (365 lb Bull, 14-Point)

**MEAT VALUE (107 lbs Retail):**
- **Fresh (30 lbs):** Backstraps (12 lbs @ 7 sp) + Ham Steaks (18 lbs @ 5 sp) = 84 + 90 = **174 sp**
- **Smoked (45 lbs finished, from 77 lbs raw):** 45 lbs @ 10 sp/lb = **450 sp**
- **SUBTOTAL MEAT:** 624 sp = **62.4 gp**

**BYPRODUCT VALUE:**
- **Hide:** 3-5 gp (hollow hair, insulation value, used for winter clothing)
- **Antlers (14-point bull):** 60 sp = 6 gp
- **Heart/Liver:** 15 sp
- **SUBTOTAL BYPRODUCTS:** 9.15-11.15 gp

**TOTAL GROSS VALUE:** 62.4 + 9.15-11.15 = **71.55-73.55 gp**

**COSTS:**
- **Expedition:** 0 gp (migration = free access)
- **Processing Labor:** 2.8-3.6 gp (butchering)
- **Smoking Labor + Materials:** 3-5 gp (smokehouse, wood, salt, 12-24 hours)
- **Packaging:** 1-2 gp (barrels, crates for smoked meat)
- **TOTAL COSTS:** 6.8-10.6 gp

**NET VALUE:** 71.55-73.55 - 6.8-10.6 = **60.95-66.75 gp per caribou**

**VOLUME HARVEST ECONOMICS (Hunter Takes 5 Caribou in 4 Days):**
- **Gross:** 5 × 71.55-73.55 gp = 357.75-367.75 gp
- **Costs:** 5 × 6.8-10.6 gp = 34-53 gp
- **NET:** 304.75-333.75 gp
- **Labor:** 4 days hunting + 6-8 days processing = 10-12 days total
- **Per-Day Return:** 25-33 gp per day (vs wapiti 10-17 gp per day, caribou MORE profitable per day worked)
