## I. CRITICAL WARNING

### **⚠️ DO NOT IMPORT TO WESTERN FAERÛN ⚠️**

Chultan pygmy antelopes are **TROPICAL SPECIALISTS**. They **CANNOT SURVIVE** in Western Faerûn's temperate climate. Every import attempt has resulted in **100% mortality** within 1-6 months.

**FAILED IMPORT HISTORY:**
- **1461 DR (Waterdeep Noble Estate):** 12 pygmy antelopes imported, all dead within 3 months (hypothermia, respiratory disease)
- **1472 DR (Baldur's Gate Zoo):** 8 antelopes imported, all dead within 4 months (same causes)
- **1485 DR (Neverwinter Menagerie):** 6 antelopes imported, all dead within 2 months (fastest die-off on record)

**WHY THIS GUIDE INCLUDES THEM:**
- **Educational:** Document why imports fail (prevent future wasteful attempts)
- **Chultan Context:** Chultan hunters/provisioners may read this guide (relevant for local use)
- **Trade Warning:** Merchants tempted by "exotic miniature deer" must understand: **THEY WILL DIE**

**SURVIVAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Temperature:** 70-95°F year-round (Western Faerûn winters 20-40°F = FATAL)
- **Humidity:** 60-95% (Western Faerûn 30-50% = respiratory failure)
- **Vegetation:** Tropical browse (specific plants, unavailable in temperate forests)

**IF YOU SEE CHULTAN ANTELOPES FOR SALE IN WESTERN FAERÛN:** The seller is either ignorant OR fraudulent. **DO NOT BUY.** You will lose 50-200 gp per antelope + watch them suffer and die within weeks/months.

## II. BREED OVERVIEW (Chultan Context Only)

### The Smallest "Deer" (Not Actually Deer)

**TAXONOMIC CLARIFICATION:**

Pygmy antelopes are **NOT cervines** (deer family). They are **antilopines** (antelope family). Key differences:

| Feature | True Cervines (Deer) | Pygmy Antelopes |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Antlers** | Shed annually, bone, both sexes OR males only | Permanent horns, keratin, males only |
| **Family** | Cervidae | Bovidae (related to cattle/goats, NOT deer) |
| **Geographic Range** | Worldwide | Africa/Chult only |
| **Climate** | Temperate/arctic | Tropical ONLY |

**WHY INCLUDED IN CERVINE GUIDE:**
- **Size/Appearance:** Look like tiny deer (50-90 lbs, deer-like proportions)
- **Market Confusion:** Merchants sell as "exotic deer" (misleading, but common)
- **Hunting Techniques:** Similar to roe deer hunting (small, forest-dwelling)

---

## III. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS (Chultan Populations)

### Size and Build

**ADULT MALE (Ram):**
- **Live Weight:** 50-90 lbs (avg 70 lbs, **smaller than roe deer 60 lbs, smallest in this guide**)
- **Shoulder Height:** 20-26 inches (knee-height to most humans)
- **Body Length:** 30-40 inches
- **Build:** Extremely delicate (thin legs, small frame)

**ADULT FEMALE (Ewe):**
- **Live Weight:** 45-80 lbs (avg 62 lbs)
- **Shoulder Height:** 18-24 inches
- **Body Length:** 28-38 inches

**SIZE COMPARISON:**
| Metric | Pygmy Antelope | Roe Deer | Whitetail |
|--------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Weight | 70 lbs | 60 lbs | 150 lbs |
| Height | 23 inches | 26 inches | 38 inches |
| Yield | 22 lbs retail | 18 lbs retail | 52 lbs retail |

---

### Horns (NOT Antlers)

**MALES ONLY (Unlike Deer Antlers):**
- **Structure:** Short, straight spikes (4-7 inches tall)
- **Composition:** Keratin (same as cow horns, fingernails), **NOT bone like antlers**
- **Growth:** Permanent (grow continuously, never shed)
- **Rings:** Annual growth rings (can age ram by counting rings)

**FEMALES:** No horns (unlike caribou/moonlit deer where both sexes have antlers)

**HORN VALUE:** Minimal (5-15 sp, decorative only, too small for practical tools)

---

### Coat and Coloration

**YEAR-ROUND COAT (No Seasonal Change):**
- **Body:** Reddish-brown to golden-tan (tropical coloration)
- **Underparts:** White (belly, throat)
- **Face Markings:** White eye-rings, black nose
- **Ears:** Large relative to head (4-5 inches, thermoregulation for tropical heat)

**IDENTIFYING FEATURES:**
- **Tiny Size:** Smallest "deer-like" animal (20-26 inches tall)
- **Permanent Horns:** NOT antlers (diagnostic for antelope vs deer)
- **Large Ears:** Oversized relative to head (thermal adaptation)

---

## IV. WHY THEY DIE IN WESTERN FAERÛN

### Temperature Intolerance

**TROPICAL REQUIREMENT: 70-95°F Year-Round**

**WESTERN FAERÛN CLIMATE:**
| Season | Temp Range | Pygmy Antelope Survival |
|--------|------------|-------------------------|
| Summer (Kythorn-Eleasis) | 65-85°F | MARGINAL (barely survive, stress) |
| Fall (Eleint-Uktar) | 45-65°F | POOR (hypothermia begins) |
| Winter (Nightal-Alturiak) | 20-40°F | FATAL (death within days/weeks) |
| Spring (Ches-Mirtul) | 40-60°F | POOR (if survived winter, weakened) |

**PHYSIOLOGY:**
- **No Winter Coat:** Pygmy antelopes have thin tropical coat (10-15 mm hair vs deer 40-60 mm winter coat)
- **High Surface Area to Mass Ratio:** Small body size = rapid heat loss (cannot generate enough body heat to compensate)
- **Tropical Metabolism:** Evolved for heat dissipation, NOT heat retention (shiver constantly in <60°F temperatures)

**DEATH MECHANISM:**
- **Hypothermia:** Core temperature drops below 95°F (normal 100-102°F), organ failure within hours/days
- **Immune Collapse:** Chronic cold stress weakens immune system (pneumonia, respiratory infections = 90% of import deaths)

---

### Humidity and Respiratory Disease

**CHULTAN HUMIDITY: 60-95% Year-Round**

**WESTERN FAERÛN HUMIDITY:**
- Summer: 50-70% (tolerable)
- Winter: 20-40% (CRITICALLY DRY for tropical animals)

**RESPIRATORY ADAPTATION:**
- **Nasal Passages:** Pygmy antelope nasal passages adapted for humid air (thin mucous membranes, high moisture exchange)
- **Dry Air Damage:** Low humidity dries membranes (cracking, bleeding, infection entry points)
- **Progressive Pneumonia:** 75% of import deaths = respiratory failure (lungs cannot function in dry air)

---

### Dietary Specificity

**TROPICAL BROWSE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Primary Food:** Tropical forbs, shrubs, fruits (species endemic to Chult, absent in Western Faerûn)
- **Digestive Enzymes:** Specialized gut bacteria (break down tropical plant toxins, cannot process temperate vegetation efficiently)

**WESTERN FAERÛN SUBSTITUTION ATTEMPTS (All Failed):**
- **Hay + Grain:** Antelopes eat, but malnourished (missing vitamins, minerals, digestive bacteria die off)
- **Imported Tropical Plants:** Expensive (10-30 gp per week), insufficient (need variety, not just 2-3 species)
- **Result:** Progressive weight loss, organ failure (starvation despite eating, gut microbiome collapse)

---

## V. CHULTAN CONTEXT (Where They Belong)

### Geographic Range (Chult Only)

**CHULTAN JUNGLE (Core Habitat):**
- **Northern Chult:** 8,000-15,000 individuals (coastal jungles, near Port Nyanzaru)
- **Central Chult:** 12,000-20,000 individuals (deep jungle, optimal habitat)
- **Southern Chult:** 5,000-10,000 individuals (montane forests, higher elevation, cooler but still tropical)
- **TOTAL:** 25,000-45,000 individuals (abundant in Chult, stable populations)

---

### Chultan Hunting and Use

**SUBSISTENCE HUNTING:**
- **Tribal Use:** Batiri goblins, Chultan humans (small game, supplement diet)
- **Yield:** 22 lbs retail (small, but easier to hunt than larger game)
- **Value:** Low in Chult (common, many available, 2-5 gp per antelope locally)

**TRAP HUNTING (Most Common Method):**
- **Snares:** Wire snares on game trails (antelopes follow fixed routes)
- **Success Rate:** 60-80% (easier than bow hunting, antelopes very small target)
- **Time:** Check traps daily (meat spoils quickly in tropical heat, 4-8 hours)

**MEAT PRESERVATION (Tropical Challenge):**
- **Fresh Consumption:** Preferred (eat within 6-12 hours, jungle heat spoils meat rapidly)
- **Smoking:** Necessary for storage (1-2 days smoking, yields 10-12 lbs smoked meat per antelope)
- **Salt:** Expensive in jungle (imported from coast, 5-10 sp per lb salt, rarely used)

---

## VI. YIELD AND PROCESSING (Chultan Methods)

### Yield Calculation (70 lb Pygmy Antelope)

**STEP 1: Live to Dressed (60%)**
- Live Weight: 70 lbs
- Dressing %: 60% (lower than deer 65% due to very delicate build, high organ-to-body ratio)
- Dressed Weight: 70 × 60% = **42 lbs**

**STEP 2: Dressed to Retail (52%)**
- Dressed Weight: 42 lbs
- Retail %: 52% (higher than deer 45% due to very fine bones, minimal waste)
- Retail Weight: 42 × 52% = **22 lbs**

**FINAL TOTAL YIELD:** 31% (70 lbs live → 22 lbs retail, **slightly higher % than deer due to fine structure**).

**SMALL YIELD:** Pygmy antelope = **smallest yield** in this guide (22 lbs vs roe deer 18 lbs, whitetail 52 lbs).

---

### Meat Quality

**TASTE:**
- **Mild, Sweet:** Similar to roe deer (delicate, minimal gamey notes)
- **Tropical Browse Influence:** Faint fruity notes (from tropical fruit diet)

**TEXTURE:**
- **Very Fine Grain:** Finest of any cervine/antelope (tiny muscle fibers)
- **Naturally Tender:** Minimal aging required (2-3 days vs deer 7-14 days)

**COLOR:**
- **Pale Red:** Lighter than deer (less myoglobin, small animal)

**CHULTAN MARKET VALUE (Local):**
- **Steaks:** 3-5 sp/lb (cheap locally, common game)
- **Smoked Meat:** 6-9 sp/lb (preservation labor, longer storage)
- **Total Value (22 lbs retail):** 66-110 sp = **6.6-11 gp** (low value in Chult, abundant supply)

---

## VII. IMPORT ECONOMICS (Why Merchants Try Despite Failure)

### False Profit Calculation (Merchant Deception)

**MERCHANT PITCH (Fraudulent):**
- **Purchase Cost (Chult):** 2-5 gp per live antelope
- **Transport Cost (Ship):** 10-20 gp per antelope (6-8 week voyage, Port Nyanzaru to Baldur's Gate)
- **Sale Price (Western Faerûn):** 50-200 gp per live antelope ("exotic miniature deer," marketed to nobles)
- **PROJECTED PROFIT:** 35-185 gp per antelope (500-3,700% markup)

**REALITY:**
- **Survival Rate (Voyage):** 50-70% (tropical animals stressed by ship travel, temperature fluctuations)
- **Survival Rate (Post-Import, First Month):** 30-50% (winter arrival = rapid death)
- **Survival Rate (6 Months):** 0% (ALL DEAD, 100% mortality proven by historical attempts)

**ACTUAL ECONOMICS:**
- **10 Antelopes Purchased:** 20-50 gp cost
- **Transport:** 100-200 gp
- **Survival to Sale:** 5-7 antelopes (3-5 die in transit)
- **Sales:** 5-7 × 50-200 gp = 250-1,400 gp gross
- **Refunds/Lawsuits (All Die Within 6 Months):** -125-700 gp (50% refund OR sued for fraud)
- **NET PROFIT:** 5-450 gp (highly variable, often negative once reputation damaged)

**WHY MERCHANTS PERSIST:**
- **Ignorance:** Don't know about 100% mortality (first-time importers)
- **Fraud:** Know they'll die, plan to sell quickly and disappear before deaths occur (scam artists)
- **Optimism Bias:** "This time will be different" (always fails)

## VIII. NOBLE BUYER WARNING

### If Offered Chultan Pygmy Antelopes

**RED FLAGS:**
- **"Exotic Miniature Deer":** Misleading (they're antelopes, not deer, will die)
- **"Perfect for Estate Parks":** FALSE (cannot survive temperate winters)
- **"Rare, Limited Availability":** Creating false scarcity (rare in Western Faerûn because THEY ALL DIE)

**QUESTIONS TO ASK SELLER:**
- **"What is the survival rate in Western Faerûn winters?"** (Honest answer: 0%. If seller says otherwise, lying.)
- **"Can you provide references from previous buyers whose antelopes lived >1 year?"** (They cannot. None exist.)
- **"Will you refund if they die within 6 months?"** (If yes, get in writing. If no, walk away.)

**ALTERNATIVE:**
- **Want Small Deer?** Buy **roe deer** (60 lbs, similar size, NATIVE to Western Faerûn, will survive)
- **Want Exotic?** Buy **fallow deer** (spotted coat, "exotic look," 160 lbs, hardy, survives well)

---

## IX. CHULTAN GUIDE RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Chultan Hunters/Provisioners

**OPTIMAL HARVEST:**
- **Season:** Year-round (no winter, tropical climate stable)
- **Method:** Snare traps (wire, game trails, 60-80% success)
- **Processing:** Immediate (4-8 hours in jungle heat = spoilage begins)

**PRESERVATION:**
- **Smoking:** Mandatory for storage (10-12 lbs smoked per antelope, 1-2 day process)
- **Salt:** Too expensive (unless coastal access, 5-10 sp/lb salt)
- **Fresh Sale:** Best option (Port Nyanzaru markets, 6.6-11 gp per antelope)

**LOCAL MARKET (Port Nyanzaru):**
- **Demand:** Moderate (locals prefer larger game, antelopes = "peasant meat")
- **Price:** 6.6-11 gp per antelope (cheap, abundant)
- **Competition:** Dinosaur meat (larger yields, more prestigious, antelopes compete poorly)
