---

## I. BREED OVERVIEW

### The Smallest Cervine in Western Faerûn

The Ardeep Roe Deer represents the **opposite extreme** from elk and moose. Where those breeds offer bulk meat for expeditions and feasts, roe deer provide **delicate, refined portions** for intimate dinners and noble tables.

**KEY CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Smallest Deer:** 40-80 lbs (vs whitetail 120-180 lbs, 60-70% smaller)
- **Lowest Yield:** 18-25 lbs retail (vs whitetail 52 lbs, 65% less meat)
- **Highest Price:** 6-10 sp/lb (vs whitetail 3-5 sp/lb, 80-200% premium)
- **Most Tender:** Naturally tender (minimal muscle development, less aging required)
- **Finest Grain:** Smallest muscle fibers (silky texture when cooked)
- **Luxury Market:** Noble estates, fine dining establishments, special occasions

**MARKET POSITION:** Roe deer occupy the **"small game luxury"** niche. A whitetail feeds a family of 6 for a month; a roe deer provides an elegant dinner for 4-6 people. The entire deer is often purchased for a single special meal.

## II. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

### Primary Range

**ARDEEP FOREST (Core Population):**
- **Southern Ardeep:** 2,500-4,000 individuals (closest to Waterdeep, 1 day travel)
- **Central Ardeep:** 1,500-2,500 individuals (mixed with whitetail populations)
- **Northern Ardeep:** 800-1,500 individuals (transitions to Neverwinter Wood)
- **Total Ardeep:** 4,800-8,000 individuals (most dense population)

**SECONDARY RANGE:**
- **Neverwinter Wood (Southern):** 1,000-1,800 individuals
- **Misty Forest:** 500-1,200 individuals (scattered, small pockets)
- **Noble Estates:** 200-500 individuals (semi-domesticated park populations, see below)

**TOTAL POPULATION:** 6,500-11,500 individuals (rarest common deer in this guide)

---

### Noble Estate Park Populations

**SEMI-DOMESTICATION:**

Wealthy noble houses maintain **enclosed park populations** of roe deer for:
- **Aesthetic Appeal:** Beautiful, graceful animals (landscaping feature)
- **Controlled Hunting:** Guests hunt within estate grounds (low-difficulty hunts for inexperienced nobles)
- **Guaranteed Meat:** Reliable venison supply for estate kitchens

**NOTABLE ESTATE POPULATIONS:**
- **Waterdeep (Various Noble Villas):** 50-100 roe deer total across multiple estates
- **Amphail Noble Estates:** 30-60 roe deer (Ammakyl, Eagleshield, Ilzimmer families)
- **Daggerford Castle Grounds:** 20-40 roe deer (Duke's hunting park)

**PARK DEER CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Less Wary:** Habituated to humans (easier to approach, simpler harvests)
- **Consistent Quality:** Managed feeding (supplemental grain, predictable meat quality)
- **Smaller Antlers:** Less competition = less antler development (wild bucks superior)
- **Higher Price:** Estate venison commands **+30-50% premium** (guaranteed provenance, "estate-raised" marketing)

**PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:** Estate deer = property of landowner (trespassing penalties 100-500 gp + jail time).

## III. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### Size and Dimorphism

**ADULT MALE (Buck/Roebuck):**
- **Live Weight:** 40-80 lbs (avg 60 lbs, **60% smaller than whitetail**)
- **Shoulder Height:** 24-28 inches (vs whitetail 36-40 inches)
- **Body Length:** 38-50 inches
- **Build:** Compact, delicate (fine-boned, slender legs)

**ADULT FEMALE (Doe):**
- **Live Weight:** 35-65 lbs (avg 50 lbs)
- **Shoulder Height:** 22-26 inches
- **Body Length:** 36-48 inches
- **Barely Distinguishable from Males (Outside Rut):** Similar size, does slightly more rounded

**SIZE COMPARISON:**
| Metric | Whitetail Male | Roe Deer Male | Difference |
|--------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Weight | 150 lbs | 60 lbs | -90 lbs (-60%) |
| Height | 38 inches | 26 inches | -12 inches (-32%) |
| Retail Yield | 52 lbs | 18-20 lbs | -32 lbs (-62%) |

**VISUAL SCALE:** A roe deer buck stands **at the shoulder height** of a medium-sized dog (retriever, shepherd). They are astonishingly small when seen next to whitetail or mule deer.

---

### Coat and Coloration

**SUMMER COAT (Kythorn-Eleasis):**
- **Color:** Bright reddish-brown to golden-tan (vibrant, eye-catching)
- **Throat/Chin:** White bib (heart-shaped patch, diagnostic identifier)
- **Rump Patch:** Cream to white (kidney-shaped, expands when alarmed)

**WINTER COAT (Uktar-Mirtul):**
- **Color:** Grayish-brown to mouse-gray (muted, cryptic)
- **Throat/Chin:** White bib persists (year-round feature)
- **Rump Patch:** Pure white (more prominent in winter)
- **Texture:** Thick, dense (20-30 mm hair length)

**FAWN SPOTS:**
- **Present at Birth:** Pronounced white spots (2-4 mm diameter, 40-60 spots)
- **Duration:** Fade by 2-3 months (earlier than whitetail 3-4 months)

**IDENTIFYING FEATURES:**
- **White Heart-Shaped Chin Patch:** Diagnostic (no other Western Faerûn deer has this)
- **Black Nose/Muzzle:** Contrasts with tan face (distinctive "mask" appearance)
- **Short Tail:** Nearly invisible (1-2 inches, barely extends past rump)

---

### Antler Characteristics

**SIZE AND STRUCTURE:**
- **Points:** 4-8 points typical (2-4 per side, smaller range than whitetail)
- **Length:** 6-10 inches (vs whitetail 18-24 inches, 60% shorter)
- **Spread:** 6-10 inches (vs whitetail 12-18 inches)
- **Mass:** Very light (thin beams, 0.5-1 lb per antler vs whitetail 1-2 lbs)
- **Texture:** Rough, pearled surface (bumpy texture unique to roe deer)

**GROWTH CYCLE (DELAYED vs Whitetail):**

Roe deer antler cycle is **offset by ~2 months** from other cervines:

- **Uktar-Nightal:** Shedding (late fall, vs other deer Ches-Tarsakh)
- **Nightal-Alturiak:** Pedicle healing, velvet budding
- **Alturiak-Tarsakh:** Rapid velvet growth (winter growth, unusual)
- **Tarsakh-Mirtul:** Velvet stripping (spring, vs other deer Eleasis)
- **Mirtul-Uktar:** Hardened antlers (ready for rut)

**WHY THE OFFSET?** Roe deer rut in **Flamerule-Eleasis** (summer, vs other deer Marpenoth-Uktar fall rut). Antler cycle precedes rut by ~2 months, hence delayed shed/growth.

**ANTLER VALUE:**
- **Decorative Market:** Limited (small size, not impressive as trophies)
- **Specialty Market:** Taxidermy (full body mounts), noble children's rooms (appropriate scale)
- **Typical Prices:** 5-15 sp (4-6 point), 10-25 sp (exceptional 8-point)
- **Velvet Antlers:** 5-12 gp/lb (0.5-1 lb per buck = 2.5-12 gp total, LOW compared to larger deer)

**PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT:** Roe deer antlers have **minimal economic value**. The meat is the primary product (95% of total value), antlers a minor byproduct (5% of value).

---

## IV. SEASONAL BIOLOGY (Harptos Calendar)

### Unique Reproductive Timing

**ROE DEER EXCEPTION:** Unlike all other Western Faerûn cervines, roe deer rut in **SUMMER** (Flamerule-Eleasis) instead of fall.

**RUT SEASON (Flamerule-Eleasis):**
- **Peak:** Mid-Flamerule to early Eleasis (hottest time of year)
- **Buck Behavior:** Territorial (defend small territories, 10-20 acres)
- **Chasing:** Bucks chase does in circles (create visible "roe rings" in grass/vegetation)
- **Fighting:** Minimal (small antlers, less dangerous than whitetail/elk fights)

**DELAYED IMPLANTATION (Unique Biology):**
- **Breeding:** Flamerule-Eleasis (summer rut)
- **Embryo:** Does NOT implant immediately (floats in uterus for 4-5 months)
- **Implantation:** Alturiak (midwinter, embryo attaches and begins development)
- **Gestation (Post-Implantation):** 4-5 months (Alturiak to Mirtul-Kythorn)
- **Fawning:** Mirtul-Kythorn (same timing as whitetail, despite summer breeding)

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUNTERS:**
- **Summer Rut = GOOD News:** Bucks in rut during Flamerule-Eleasis (CLOSED hunting season, doesn't affect meat quality during legal season)
- **Fall/Winter Bucks = Prime Quality:** By Eleint-Marpenoth hunting season, bucks are 2-3 months post-rut (recovered, good condition)
- **Does Always Good Quality:** No rut stress during hunting season

**RESULT:** Roe deer meat quality is **consistently excellent** during hunting season (unlike whitetail/elk, where rut bucks must be avoided).

---

### Annual Cycle Overview

**SPRING (Ches-Mirtul):**
- **Ches-Tarsakh:** Antler velvet growth (rapid growth phase)
- **Mirtul:** Velvet stripping (bucks rub on bushes, antlers harden), fawning begins (late month)

**SUMMER (Kythorn-Eleasis):**
- **Kythorn:** Peak fawning (1-2 fawns, does hide fawns in tall grass)
- **Flamerule-Eleasis:** RUT SEASON (bucks territorial, chasing does)

**FALL (Eleint-Uktar) - HUNTING SEASON:**
- **Eleint:** Peak condition (post-rut recovery, fattening for winter, BEST MEAT QUALITY)
- **Marpenoth:** Continued fattening (8-10% body fat, excellent)
- **Uktar:** Antler shedding begins (late month, bucks start losing antlers)

**WINTER (Nightal-Alturiak):**
- **Nightal-Alturiak:** Does pregnant (delayed implantation active), bucks without antlers, survival mode

---

## V. FIELD HARVESTING

### Hunting Techniques

**CHALLENGES:**
- **Small Target:** 60 lb deer = small vital zone (6-8 inch diameter heart/lung area vs whitetail 10-12 inches)
- **Quick Movement:** Extremely agile (can change direction mid-leap, difficult tracking)
- **Dense Cover:** Prefer thick undergrowth (difficult visibility, close-range shots)

**PREFERRED METHODS:**
- **Archery (80% of Harvests):** Quiet, allows close approach (15-30 yards typical)
- **Crossbow (15%):** Moderately quiet, more power than bow
- **Firearms (5%):** Overkill (excessive damage to small carcass, rarely used)

**SHOT PLACEMENT:**
- **Broadside (Only):** Small target requires perfect angle (quartering shots too risky)
- **Vital Zone:** Behind shoulder, mid-height (6-8 inch target, precision critical)
- **Arrow Penetration:** 6-10 inches (full pass-through common, small body depth)

---

### Field Dressing

**TIME REQUIRED:**
- **Experienced:** 10-15 minutes (small carcass, quick process)
- **Novice:** 15-25 minutes

**PROCEDURE (Same Steps as Whitetail, Smaller Scale):**
1. **Position:** Deer on back (lightweight, easy to position)
2. **Initial Cut:** Sternum to pelvis (6-10 inch cut vs whitetail 8-12 inches)
3. **Open Cavity:** Cut abdominal muscle (thin layer, quick)
4. **Remove Organs:** Pull heart/lungs/intestines (10-15 lbs total vs whitetail 25-35 lbs)
5. **Save Edibles (Optional):** Heart (0.3-0.4 lbs), Liver (0.8-1.2 lbs)

**FIELD DRESSING YIELD:**
- **Live Weight:** 60 lbs
- **Field Dressed Weight:** 60 × 65% = **39 lbs** (vs whitetail 117 lbs)

**TRANSPORT:**
- **Carry Whole:** Most hunters carry entire field-dressed carcass (39 lbs manageable for one person)
- **Quartering:** Unnecessary (carcass light enough to transport whole)
- **Distance:** 0.5-2 miles typical (Ardeep Forest to cart access)

---

## VI. BUTCHER SHOP PROCESSING

### Yield Calculation (60 lb Roe Deer)

**STEP 1: Live to Dressed (65%)**
- Live Weight: 60 lbs
- Dressing %: 65% (same as whitetail)
- Dressed Weight: 60 × 65% = **39 lbs**

**STEP 2: Dressed to Retail (45-50%)**
- Dressed Weight: 39 lbs
- Retail %: **48%** (slightly higher than whitetail 45%, less waste due to smaller bones)
- Retail Weight: 39 × 48% = **18-19 lbs**

**FINAL TOTAL YIELD:** 31% (60 lbs live → 18-19 lbs retail)

**COMPARISON TO WHITETAIL:**
| Metric | Whitetail (180 lb) | Roe Deer (60 lb) | Ratio |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| Live Weight | 180 lbs | 60 lbs | 1:3 (roe = 33% of whitetail) |
| Dressed | 117 lbs | 39 lbs | 1:3 |
| Retail | 52 lbs | 18-19 lbs | 1:2.8 (roe = 36% of whitetail) |

**CUSTOMER EXPECTATION:** "One roe deer = one special dinner for 4-6 people" (vs whitetail = month of meals for family of 4).

| Ribs | 2-3 lbs | 5-8% |
| Neck | 2-3 lbs | 5-8% |
| Shanks (4) | 2-3 lbs | 5-8% |

**PROCESSING CHALLENGES:**

**Small Size = Detail Work:**
- **Backstraps:** Only 8-12 inches long, 1-1.5 inches diameter (delicate removal required)
- **Tenderloins:** Tiny (6-8 inches long, 0.5-inch diameter, easy to damage)
- **Ribs:** 6-8 inches long (individual chops barely 2-3 oz, often left as rack)

**PROCESSING TIME:**
- **Journeyman Butcher:** 3-4 hours (slower than whitetail despite smaller size, precision required)
- **Labor Cost:** 12-16 sp (vs whitetail 24-32 sp, 50% less)

---

### Secondary Breakdown (Butcher's Choice)

**CUSTOMER OPTIONS:**

**SHOULDERS (12-14 lbs total):**
- **Option 1: Small Roasts** - 2 roasts, 6-7 lbs each (serve 3-4 people each)
- **Option 2: Grinding** - 6-8 lbs ground meat (delicate flavor, premium ground venison)
- **Professional Recommendation:** ROASTS (small size perfect for intimate dinners, grinding wastes premium quality)

**HAMS (18-22 lbs total):**
- **Option 1: Bone-In Roasts** - 2 whole hams, 9-11 lbs each (traditional presentation, roast whole)
- **Option 2: Boneless Roasts** - 4 roasts, 3-5 lbs each (easier carving, less waste)
- **Option 3: Steaks** - 8-12 steaks, 1-1.5 lbs each (individual portions, 2 steaks = 1 serving)
- **Professional Recommendation:** BONE-IN ROASTS (elegant presentation, bone adds flavor)

- **Professional Recommendation:** WHOLE (maximize tenderness, customer slices fresh)

**TENDERLOINS (0.4-0.6 lbs total):**
- **ONLY Option: WHOLE** - Too small to cut (serve 1 tenderloin per person, 2-3 oz portion)

**RIBS (2-3 lbs):**
- **Option 1: Rack** - Leave whole (French-style presentation, roast and slice)
- **Option 2: Individual Chops** - 6-8 tiny chops, 2-3 oz each (barely worthwhile)
- **Professional Recommendation:** RACK (individual chops too small, rack impressive)

**NECK/SHANKS (4-6 lbs total):**
- **Standard: Stew/Braise** - Neck grinding OR stew cubes, shanks left whole for braising

---

### Aging Requirements

**MINIMAL AGING NEEDED:**

Roe deer require **LESS aging** than whitetail due to:
- **Less Muscle Development:** Small, delicate muscles (naturally tender)
- **Lower Activity Level:** Less strenuous lifestyle (compared to whitetail/elk constant movement)
- **Finer Grain:** Smaller muscle fibers (break down faster)

**AGING SCHEDULE:**
- **Minimum:** 5-7 days (vs whitetail 7-10 days)
- **Standard:** 7-9 days (vs whitetail 10-12 days)
- **Extended:** 10-12 days (vs whitetail 14-16 days, only for trophy bucks)
- **Temperature:** 34-38°F (same as all cervines)
- **Humidity:** 70-75%

**PROFESSIONAL TIP:** Roe deer can be processed **faster turnaround** than whitetail (5-7 days aging + processing = ready in 1 week vs whitetail 2 weeks).

### Whole Deer Value (60 lb Roe Deer, Prime)

**MEAT VALUE (18 lbs Retail):**
- **Premium Cuts (4 lbs):** Backstraps (1.5 lbs @ 15 sp) + Tenderloins (0.5 lbs @ 22 sp) + Rib Rack (2 lbs @ 12 sp) = 22 + 11 + 24 = **57 sp**
- **Standard Cuts (12 lbs):** Ham Roasts (8 lbs @ 10 sp) + Shoulder Roasts (4 lbs @ 8 sp) = 80 + 32 = **112 sp**
- **Stew/Grind (2 lbs):** 2 lbs @ 5 sp = **10 sp**
- **SUBTOTAL MEAT:** 179 sp = **17.9 gp**

**BYPRODUCT VALUE:**
- Hide: 1.2 gp = 12 sp
- Antlers: 8 sp
- Heart/Liver: 11 sp
- **SUBTOTAL BYPRODUCTS:** 31 sp = **3.1 gp**

**TOTAL GROSS VALUE:** 17.9 + 3.1 = **21 gp**

- Packaging: 0.5-1 gp (less material needed, smaller packages)
- **TOTAL COSTS:** **1.7-2.6 gp**

**NET VALUE:** 21 - 1.7 to 2.6 = **18.3-19.3 gp**

**COMPARISON TO WHITETAIL:**
- **Whitetail (180 lb):** 41 gp gross, 35-38 gp net
- **Roe Deer (60 lb):** 21 gp gross, 18-19 gp net
- **Per-Pound Value:** Roe deer = 3.5 gp/lb live (21 gp ÷ 60 lbs) vs whitetail = 2.3 gp/lb (41 gp ÷ 180 lbs) = **+52% per-pound value**

**BUTCHER PROFIT MARGIN:**
- Roe deer: **Lower absolute profit** (18-21 gp total vs whitetail 35-41 gp)
- But: **Higher margin %** (processing 3-4 hours vs 6-8 hours = better hourly rate)
- **Faster Turnover:** 1 week aging vs 2 weeks = more deer processed per month

## VIII. CULINARY APPLICATIONS

### Meat Quality Profile

**TASTE:**
- **Mildest Cervine Flavor:** Minimal gamey notes (closest to domestic lamb)
- **Sweet Finish:** Natural sweetness (young animals, tender grass browse)
- **No Rut Influence:** Summer rut = fall hunting season unaffected (consistent quality)

**TEXTURE:**
- **Finest Grain:** Smallest muscle fibers in all cervines (silky, delicate)
- **Naturally Tender:** Minimal aging required (5-7 days vs whitetail 10-12 days)
- **Delicate Structure:** Can be OVER-tenderized if aged too long (>12 days)

**COLOR:**
- **Lighter Red:** Less myoglobin than whitetail/elk (pink-red vs dark red)
- **Clean Appearance:** Minimal silver skin, fine-textured fat (appealing presentation)

---

### Cooking Techniques

**CRITICAL RULE: DO NOT OVERCOOK**

Roe deer meat is **even more sensitive** to overcooking than whitetail:
- **Target Temp:** Rare to Medium-Rare (120-130°F, vs whitetail 125-135°F)
- **Reason:** Extremely lean (1-2% fat), fine grain (overcooks in seconds)
- **Professional Standard:** "If it's medium, you've gone too far."

---

**DIFFICULTY:** Moderate (timing critical, small window between rare and overcooked)

---

**METHOD 2: Rib Rack (French-Style Presentation)**

**TECHNIQUE:**
1. **French the Rack:** Scrape rib bones clean (expose 2-3 inches of bone)
2. **Season:** Salt, pepper, crushed juniper berries (rub onto meat)
3. **Sear:** Hot skillet, meat-side down, 2-3 minutes (crust)
4. **Roast:** 400°F oven, rack standing (bones up), 15-18 minutes (to 125°F)
5. **Rest:** 10 minutes
6. **Carve:** Slice between ribs (6-8 individual chops)

**SERVING:** 2-3 chops per person (small portions, 2-3 oz meat per chop), serve with red wine reduction.

**PRESENTATION:** Bones interlaced (crown roast style) OR lined up on platter (elegant, dramatic)

---

**METHOD 3: Ham Roast (Traditional, Family-Style)**

**TECHNIQUE:**
1. **Brown:** Sear ham on all sides, Dutch oven, 3-4 minutes per side
2. **Aromatics:** Remove ham, sauté onions, carrots, celery (5 minutes)
3. **Braise:** Add wine (1 cup) + stock (1 cup), return ham, bring to simmer
4. **Oven:** Covered, 300°F, 2-2.5 hours (to 180°F internal, fall-apart tender)
5. **Rest:** 15 minutes
6. **Slice:** Against grain, 1/4-inch slices

**SERVING:** 3-4 oz per person, with braising liquid as gravy, serves 4-6.
