## SECTION I: ANTLER BIOLOGY AND GROWTH

### **ANTLERS VS HORNS: FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION**

**ANTLERS (Cervines - Deer, Elk, Moose, Caribou):**
- **Composition:** Solid bone (calcium phosphate, collagen)
- **Growth:** Annual cycle (SHED every year, REGROW each year)
- **Coverage:** Velvet (blood-rich skin) during growth, shed when hardened
- **Gender:** Usually males only (EXCEPTION: Caribou - both sexes have antlers)
- **Structure:** Branching OR palmated (broad, flattened)
- **Blood supply:** TEMPORARY (during growth only)

**HORNS (Bovines - Cattle, Goats, Antelope including Chultan Pygmy):**
- **Composition:** Bone core + keratin sheath (like fingernails)
- **Growth:** PERMANENT (grow continuously, never shed)
- **Coverage:** Keratin sheath (permanent)
- **Gender:** Usually both sexes (varies by species)
- **Structure:** Unbranched, single point OR curved
- **Blood supply:** PERMANENT (within bone core)

**CRITICAL IDENTIFICATION:**
- **Antlers** = SHED annually, bone, branching = Deer family
- **Horns** = NEVER shed, keratin covering, unbranched = Not deer (Pygmy Antelope has HORNS not antlers)

---

### **ANNUAL ANTLER GROWTH CYCLE (HARPTOS CALENDAR)**

**LATE WINTER - SHEDDING (Late Alturiak - Early Ches):**

**Trigger mechanisms:**
- Testosterone levels drop (post-rut recovery)
- Daylight hours increasing (photoperiod)
- Nutritional stress (winter fat depletion)
- Mineral reabsorption (body reclaims calcium from antler base)

**Physical process:**
- Osteoclast cells (bone-eating cells) dissolve bone at skull plate junction
- Antler base weakens over 3-7 days
- Antlers drop (fall off) - usually 24-72 hours apart (left/right)
- Small wound remains on skull (pedicle), bleeds briefly, scabs within hours
- **NO PAIN** (nerve connection severed before drop)

**Shedding timing by breed:**
| Breed | Shedding Period | Peak Shedding |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **Giant Elk** | Late Alturiak - Early Ches | Late Alturiak |
| **Moose** | Late Alturiak - Mid Ches | Early Ches |
| **Wapiti** | Alturiak - Mid Ches | Early Ches |
| **Red Deer** | Alturiak - Mid Ches | Early Ches |
| **Caribou** | Nightal - Alturiak (bulls), Mirtul (cows)* | Nightal (bulls) |
| **All smaller deer** | Alturiak - Ches | Early Ches |

*Caribou: Bulls shed in winter (Nightal-Alturiak), pregnant cows retain until after calving (Mirtul)

---

**SPRING - VELVET GROWTH BEGINS (Ches - Mirtul):**

**Initiation:**
- Testosterone rises (spring hormones)
- Pedicle (skull attachment point) begins tissue growth
- First visible growth: "buttons" (small bumps, 1-2 weeks after shedding)

**Velvet characteristics:**
- **Velvet = specialized skin covering growing antler**
- Rich blood supply (thousands of capillaries)
- Nerve endings (sensitive to touch, bulls avoid damage)
- Short fur covering (gives "velvet" appearance)
- Warm to touch (blood flow)

**Growth initiation by breed:**
| Breed | Growth Begins | First Visible (buttons) |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Giant Elk** | Early Ches | Mid Ches (3-4 weeks after shed) |
| **Moose** | Early Ches | Mid Ches |
| **Wapiti** | Ches | Mid-Late Ches |
| **Red Deer** | Ches | Mid-Late Ches |
| **Caribou** | Ches | Mid-Late Ches |
| **Smaller deer** | Ches | Late Ches |

---

**SUMMER - RAPID GROWTH (Kythorn - Eleasis):**

**Growth rate:**
- **FASTEST-GROWING TISSUE IN ANY MAMMAL**
- 1-2 inches per WEEK (large elk)
- 0.5-1 inch per week (smaller deer)
- **Example:** Giant Elk grows 70-110 inch spread in 16-20 weeks = 3.5-6.9 inches per week

**Nutritional requirements:**
- **MASSIVE calcium and phosphorus demand**
- Bulls seek mineral licks (natural salt/mineral deposits)
- Chew shed antlers, bones (reclaim minerals)
- Increased forage intake (+20-30% over normal)
- Preferential feeding (select high-mineral plants)

**Resource allocation:**
- Bulls prioritize antler growth OVER fat storage
- Body condition may decline slightly (trade-off)
- **Post-rut bulls** start summer thin, antler growth delays fat recovery

**Velvet protection:**
- Bulls AVOID contact (velvet is sensitive, easily damaged)
- Stay in cover (protect from branches)
- Less aggressive (can't use soft antlers for fighting)

---

**LATE SUMMER - MINERALIZATION (Eleasis - Early Eleint):**

**Hardening process:**
- Growth slows (antlers reach full size by late Eleasis)
- Calcium deposition increases (bone density increases)
- Blood supply begins to diminish (vessels at base constrict)
- Velvet begins to lose blood flow (starting at tips, progressing to base)

**Testosterone surge:**
- Pre-rut hormone increase
- Triggers final mineralization
- Prepares for rut (antlers must be hard for fighting)

---

**EARLY FALL - VELVET SHEDDING (Mid Eleint):**

**Velvet shedding process:**
- Blood supply cut off completely (antlers fully mineralized)
- Velvet dies (no blood = tissue death)
- Velvet dries, cracks, peels
- Bulls **actively rub** antlers on trees, brush (remove velvet)
- **Rubbing period: 3-7 days** (until all velvet removed)

**Rubbing behavior:**
- Select small trees, saplings (flexible, abrasive bark)
- Thrash vigorously (violent shaking, scraping)
- Rub all surfaces (ensure complete velvet removal)
- **"Rub trees"** = visible damage (bark stripped, broken branches, scarred trunks)

**Antler appearance post-velvet:**
- Clean, polished bone (white to brown)
- Color staining from tree sap, bark tannins (darker = more rubbing)
- Sharp points (deadly weapons)
- Ready for rut combat

**Velvet shedding timing:**
| Breed | Velvet Shedding Period | Duration |
|-------|----------------------|----------|
| **Giant Elk** | Mid-Late Eleint | 5-8 days |
| **Moose** | Mid-Late Eleint | 5-8 days |
| **Wapiti** | Early-Mid Eleint | 4-7 days |
| **Red Deer** | Mid Eleint | 4-6 days |
| **Caribou** | Mid-Late Eleint | 4-7 days |
| **Smaller deer** | Mid-Late Eleint | 3-5 days |

---

**FALL - RUT SEASON (Marpenoth - Uktar):**

**Antler function during rut:**
- **Visual display:** Size = dominance signal (larger antlers = intimidation)
- **Combat weapons:** Sparring, shoving matches, goring
- **Territorial marking:** Rub trees, thrash brush (scent marking + visual)

**Antler condition:**
- PEAK hardness (maximum density, strength)
- Polished from use (rubbing, fighting)
- May show battle damage (chips, cracks, broken points) by late rut

**Testosterone peak:**
- Highest levels of year (drives aggression, libido)
- Maintains antler attachment (prevents premature shedding)

---

**WINTER - DETERIORATION (Nightal - Alturiak):**

**Post-rut changes:**
- Testosterone crashes (rut exhaustion, hormonal cycle end)
- Antler base begins weakening (preparing for spring shedding)
- Osteoclast activity increases (bone resorption at skull junction)

**Antler condition:**
- Battle damage visible (cracked tips, broken points from fights)
- Weathering (sun exposure, aging)
- **No further growth or repair** (antlers are dead bone)

**Cycle repeats:** Shed in late Alturiak-Early Ches, regrow starting Ches

---

### **FACTORS AFFECTING ANTLER SIZE**

**GENETIC POTENTIAL (40-50% of antler size):**

**Inherited traits:**
- Maximum size potential (some bloodlines produce larger antlers)
- Point count tendency (genetics influence branching pattern)
- Beam thickness (bone density, circumference)
- Spread width (skull width, angle of growth)

**Breed-specific genetics:**
- Giant Elk: Genetic potential for 70-125+ inch spread
- Moose: Palmated structure (genetically determined)
- Caribou: Both sexes antlered (unique genetic trait)

**Selective breeding:**
- Estate herds (Fallow Deer): Select for larger antlers over generations
- Wild populations: Natural selection (larger bulls breed more = pass on large-antler genes)

---

**AGE (30-35% of antler size):**

**Age-based antler progression:**

| Age Class | Antler Development | Size (% of maximum) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Yearling (1 year)** | Spikes or small forks | 10-20% |
| **2-3 years** | Developing points, small spread | 30-50% |
| **4-6 years (Mature)** | Good points, moderate spread | 60-80% |
| **7-10 years (Prime)** | Maximum points, large spread | 90-100% |
| **8-12 years (Trophy)** | PEAK SIZE, best genetics expressed | 95-110%* |
| **12-15 years (Old)** | Declining size, fewer points | 70-90% |
| **15+ years (Very Old)** | Continued decline, poor condition | 50-70% |

*Trophy bulls (8-12 years) may exceed 100% of "average maximum" for breed (record-class individuals)

**Key insight:** Bulls don't reach trophy antler size until 8-12 years old = EXPERIENCED, DANGEROUS animals

---

**NUTRITION (20-25% of antler size):**

**Critical nutrients:**
- **Calcium:** Primary antler component (bone = calcium phosphate)
- **Phosphorus:** Bone structure, mineralization
- **Protein:** Collagen matrix (framework for calcium deposition)
- **Magnesium, Zinc, Copper:** Trace minerals (antler hardness, density)

**Forage quality:**
- High-quality browse (willow, aspen, new growth) = larger antlers
- Poor forage (low minerals, old growth) = smaller antlers
- Access to mineral licks = +10-15% antler size

**Seasonal nutrition:**
- **Spring/Summer:** Critical period (growth occurs), adequate food = larger antlers
- **Fall/Winter:** Less impact (growth complete), but affects next year (body condition)

**Habitat quality correlation:**
- Rich soils (limestone regions) = high mineral content = larger antlers
- Poor soils (sandy, acidic) = low minerals = smaller antlers

---

**HEALTH AND STRESS (5-10% of antler size):**

**Disease and injury:**
- Chronic illness (parasites, disease) = reduced antler growth (-15-30%)
- Leg injuries (reduced mobility = poor foraging) = smaller antlers
- **Antler damage during growth (velvet)** = permanent deformity that year

**Environmental stress:**
- Harsh winters (heavy snow, extreme cold) = body prioritizes survival over antlers
- Drought (poor forage) = smaller antlers
- Over-population (competition for food) = reduced antler size across population

**Social stress:**
- Subordinate bulls (harassed by dominant bulls) = stress hormones = smaller antlers
- Dominant bulls (less stress, better feeding) = larger antlers

---

**REGIONAL VARIATION SUMMARY:**

**Largest antlers (best nutrition, genetics):**
1. **Spine of the World Giant Elk:** Remote, pristine habitat, low stress, rich minerals = largest subspecies
2. **Lurkwood populations:** Old-growth forest, mature animals, low hunting pressure
3. **High Moor Wapiti:** Alpine meadows, rich forage, low population density

**Smaller antlers (nutritional limits, stress):**
1. **Icewind Dale Borderlands:** Harsh climate, limited growing season = smaller on average
2. **Evermoors (northern):** Bog habitat, acidic soils, lower minerals
3. **Over-hunted regions:** Younger age class (harvest before prime), genetic pressure

## SECTION II: GUILD OF HUNTERS SCORING SYSTEM

### **OFFICIAL MEASUREMENT PROTOCOLS**

**WHO CAN SCORE:**
- **Official Guild Scorers:** Certified by Guild of Hunters (Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Luskan, Silverymoon)
- **Training:** 2-year apprenticeship + exam (pass rate: 60-70%)
- **Certification fee:** 25-50 gp (initial), 10 gp annual renewal

**WHEN TO SCORE:**
- **Minimum drying period:** 60 days after harvest (antlers shrink slightly as moisture evaporates)
- **Optimal:** 90-120 days (fully dried, stable dimensions)
- **Green score:** Immediate measurement (unofficial, estimate only, may shrink 2-5% during drying)

**REQUIRED TOOLS:**
- **Flexible steel tape:** 1/4 inch width, 100+ inch length (measures curves, spreads)
- **Calipers:** Measure circumference, point lengths
- **Carpenter's square:** Verify perpendicular measurements
- **Plumb line:** Ensure level measurements (spread, height)
- **Score sheets:** Official Guild forms (prevent fraud, standardized recording)

---

### **SCORING COMPONENTS BREAKDOWN (400 POINT MAXIMUM)**

**COMPONENT 1: SPREAD (160 points max = 40% of total)**

**What is measured:**
- **Widest outside spread:** Greatest distance between outermost points (perpendicular to centerline of skull)
- Measured with flexible tape, straight line (NOT following antler curve)

**How to measure:**
1. Position skull level (use plumb line, verify front-to-back level)
2. Identify widest points (often mid-beam OR palmated sections for moose/Giant Elk)
3. Measure perpendicular to skull centerline (NOT diagonal)
4. Record to nearest 1/8 inch

**Scoring formula:**
- Spread (inches) × 1.6 = Points
- **Example:** 100-inch spread = 160 points (MAXIMUM for this component)

**Common errors:**
- Measuring diagonally (inflates spread = disqualified)
- Antlers not level (measure appears wider than reality = invalid)
- Following antler curves (must be straight-line = incorrect)

**Breed-specific spreads:**
| Breed | Common Spread | Trophy Spread | Record Spread | Points (Trophy) |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Giant Elk** | 70-90" | 95-110" | 110-125"+ | 152-176 |
| **Moose** | 45-60" | 65-75" | 75-85"+ | 104-120 |
| **Wapiti** | 40-55" | 60-65" | 65-75"+ | 96-104 |
| **Caribou** | 30-45" | 45-50" | 50-60"+ | 72-80 |
| **Red Deer** | 30-42" | 42-48" | 48-56"+ | 67-77 |

---

**COMPONENT 2: MAIN BEAM LENGTH (100 points max = 25% of total)**

**What is measured:**
- **Longest continuous measurement along center of main beam**
- From base (pedicle attachment) to furthest tip
- Follows natural curve of beam

**How to measure:**
1. Identify main beam (primary antler shaft, NOT points/tines)
2. Use flexible tape, press against beam (follow all curves)
3. Start at base (where antler meets skull)
4. Follow center of beam to tip
5. Measure BOTH beams (left and right), **average the two**
6. Record to nearest 1/8 inch

**Scoring formula:**
- Main beam length (inches, average of both sides) × 1.25 = Points
- **Example:** 60-inch beam (average) = 75 points

**Common errors:**
- Measuring along outside edge (longer than center = incorrect)
- Including points/tines in measurement (beam ONLY = must exclude points)
- Not averaging both sides (must use average = if unequal, single-side score is invalid)

**Breed-specific beam lengths:**
| Breed | Common Beam | Trophy Beam | Record Beam | Points (Trophy) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Giant Elk** | 45-60" | 60-70" | 70-80"+ | 75-87.5 |
| **Moose** | 40-55" | 55-65" | 65-75"+ | 68.75-81.25 |
| **Wapiti** | 45-55" | 55-65" | 65-75"+ | 68.75-81.25 |
| **Caribou** | 35-45" | 45-55" | 55-65"+ | 56.25-68.75 |
| **Red Deer** | 35-45" | 45-52" | 52-60"+ | 56.25-65 |

---

**COMPONENT 3: TOTAL POINTS (80 points max = 20% of total)**

**What is counted:**
- **Any projection longer than 1 inch** (measured from base of point to tip)
- Counted on BOTH antlers combined
- Includes main points AND abnormal points

**How to measure:**
1. Identify all projections (points, tines)
2. Measure each from base to tip (straight line, NOT following curve)
3. **IF ≥1 inch:** COUNT IT
4. **IF <1 inch:** DO NOT COUNT
5. Sum total from both antlers

**Scoring formula:**
- Total point count × 2 = Points
- **Example:** 30 total points = 60 points

**Common errors:**
- Counting bumps <1 inch (must be ≥1 inch = incorrect)
- Not measuring (visual estimation = often wrong)
- Forgetting to count both sides (must include left + right)

**Point count by breed:**
| Breed | Common Points | Trophy Points | Record Points | Score Points (Trophy) |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Giant Elk** | 18-28 | 34-40 | 40-46 | 68-80 |
| **Moose** | 12-20 | 20-24 | 24-30+ | 40-48 |
| **Wapiti** | 10-12 | 12-14 | 14-16+ | 24-28 |
| **Caribou** | 18-24 | 24-28 | 28-34+ | 48-56 |
| **Red Deer** | 10-14 | 14-16 | 16-20+ | 28-32 |

---

**COMPONENT 4: MASS/CIRCUMFERENCE (40 points max = 10% of total)**

**What is measured:**
- **Circumference of main beam at 4 locations per antler** (8 total measurements)
- Locations: Base, 1/4 length, 1/2 length, 3/4 length
- Measures thickness, bone density

**How to measure:**
1. Use calipers OR flexible tape wrapped around beam
2. Measure at 4 equally-spaced locations per beam
3. Record each measurement to nearest 1/8 inch
4. Average all 8 measurements (4 per antler × 2 antlers)

**Scoring formula:**
- Average circumference (inches) × 5 = Points
- **Example:** 8-inch average circumference = 40 points (MAXIMUM)

**Common errors:**
- Measuring at irregular locations (must be evenly spaced = invalid)
- Including palmated sections (measure beam ONLY, not palms = incorrect)
- Not averaging (must use average of all 8 measurements)

**Circumference by breed:**
| Breed | Common Circum. | Trophy Circum. | Record Circum. | Score (Trophy) |
|-------|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Giant Elk** | 6-8" | 8-10" | 10-12"+ | 40 |
| **Moose** | 6-8" | 8-9" | 9-11"+ | 40 |
| **Wapiti** | 5-7" | 7-8" | 8-10"+ | 35-40 |
| **Caribou** | 4-6" | 6-7" | 7-9"+ | 30-35 |
| **Red Deer** | 4-6" | 6-7" | 7-9"+ | 30-35 |

---

**COMPONENT 5: SYMMETRY (20 points max = 5% of total)**

**What is evaluated:**
- **Comparison of left and right antlers**
- Point count match (same number of points on each side)
- Spread similarity (even growth, not lopsided)
- Beam length match (within 10% of each other)
- Overall aesthetic balance

**Scoring (subjective, scorer judgment):**

| Symmetry Quality | Description | Points Awarded |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Perfect** | Mirror-image match, identical point count, even spread | 18-20 |
| **Excellent** | Very close match, ±1 point difference, even spread | 14-17 |
| **Good** | Minor differences, ±2 points, slightly uneven | 10-13 |
| **Fair** | Noticeable differences, ±3-4 points, uneven | 5-9 |
| **Poor** | Major asymmetry, ±5+ points, lopsided | 0-4 |

**Common asymmetry causes:**
- Injury during growth (leg injury = one antler smaller, body compensates)
- Velvet damage (one side damaged = deformed growth that year)
- Genetics (some bloodlines naturally asymmetric)
- Age (old bulls often lose symmetry as antlers decline)

---

### **TOTAL SCORE CALCULATION EXAMPLE**

**EXAMPLE: Trophy Giant Elk Bull**

| Component | Measurement | Formula | Points |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Spread** | 105 inches | 105 × 1.6 | 168 |
| **Main Beam** | 65 inches (avg) | 65 × 1.25 | 81.25 |
| **Points** | 36 total | 36 × 2 | 72 |
| **Circumference** | 9 inches (avg) | 9 × 5 | 45 |
| **Symmetry** | Excellent | Subjective | 16 |
| **TOTAL SCORE** | | | **382.25** |

**Trophy Class:** Record (360+ points)

**Certification:**
- Submit to Guild of Hunters
- Official scorer verifies measurements
- Certificate issued (authenticates score)
- Entered in Record Book (if qualifies)

---

### **COMMON MEASUREMENT ERRORS (AND HOW TO AVOID THEM)**

**ERROR 1: Spread measured diagonally**
- **Result:** Inflated spread (appears larger than reality)
- **Detection:** Guild scorer re-measures, finds discrepancy, disqualifies entry
- **Avoidance:** Use carpenter's square, ensure perpendicular to skull centerline

**ERROR 2: Points <1 inch counted**
- **Result:** Inflated point count
- **Detection:** Scorer measures each point, finds sub-1-inch projections counted
- **Avoidance:** Measure EVERY point, don't visually estimate

**ERROR 3: Beam length measured on outside edge**
- **Result:** Inflated beam length (outside edge is longer than center)
- **Detection:** Scorer measures center line, finds discrepancy
- **Avoidance:** Follow center of beam, press tape to centerline

**ERROR 4: Circumference measured at incorrect locations**
- **Result:** Inflated circumference (measure thickest parts only)
- **Detection:** Scorer verifies evenly-spaced measurements
- **Avoidance:** Divide beam into 4 equal sections, measure at each

**ERROR 5: Symmetry overestimated**
- **Result:** Inflated symmetry score
- **Detection:** Scorer counts points, measures beams, identifies asymmetry
- **Avoidance:** Objective comparison (count points on each side, measure beam lengths, compare)

**FRAUD DETECTION:**
- Guild scorers trained to detect fraud (altered antlers, false measurements)
- Certificate includes physical description (specific point configuration, unique features)
- **Penalty for fraud:** Lifetime ban from Guild certification, 100-500 gp fine, confiscation of trophy

## SECTION III: FIELD CARE AND PRESERVATION

### **IMMEDIATE POST-HARVEST PROCEDURES (First 30 minutes)**

**CRITICAL:** Proper field care determines trophy quality. Mistakes made immediately post-harvest are IRREVERSIBLE.

**STEP 1: INITIAL ASSESSMENT (Immediate)**
1. Approach animal cautiously (ensure deceased, elk can injure even when down)
2. **Photograph antlers in natural position** (before any handling, for records)
3. Assess antler condition:
   - Check for broken points (may need repair)
   - Identify bloodstains, velvet remnants (can be cleaned)
   - Note unique features (for certificate description)

**STEP 2: PROTECT ANTLER TIPS (Within 5 minutes)**
1. Antler tips are SHARP, fragile (easily broken during handling)
2. **Wrap tips with cloth or leather strips**
3. Secure with cord (not too tight, just protective padding)
4. **Purpose:** Prevent breakage during field dressing, transport

**STEP 3: POSITION ANIMAL FOR PHOTOS (Within 15 minutes)**
1. Position animal upright (natural pose)
2. Prop head up (display antlers)
3. **Take trophy photos:**
   - Side profile (shows spread, beam)
   - Front view (shows symmetry, point count)
   - Close-up of antlers (scoring reference)
4. Include hunter (for scale, personal record)

**STEP 4: BEGIN FIELD DRESSING (Within 30 minutes)**
- Field dress animal per standard cervine procedures (see breed-specific files)
- **DO NOT cut throat** (if planning shoulder mount, neck hide must be intact)
- **Avoid touching antlers with bloody hands** (bloodstains are PERMANENT, difficult to clean)

---

### **SKULL CAPPING TECHNIQUES (If Not Mounting Full Head)**

**OPTION A: FULL SKULL REMOVAL (For European mount)**

**When to use:**
- Planning European mount (skull + antlers, no hide/taxidermy)
- Want maximum antler trophy flexibility (can mount various ways)
- No immediate taxidermy plans

**How to remove full skull:**
1. **Skin around head/neck**
   - Cut hide in ring around base of skull (behind jawbone)
   - Peel hide forward toward nose (difficult, requires knife work)
   - Cut hide free at nose, eyes, ears

2. **Separate head from spine**
   - Cut through muscle/connective tissue at neck-skull junction
   - Use saw or heavy knife to separate between skull and first vertebra (atlas)
   - **Result:** Entire skull with antlers attached, removed from carcass

3. **Remove lower jaw (optional but recommended)**
   - European mounts traditionally use skull WITHOUT lower jaw
   - Cut or break jaw connections at hinge points
   - **Result:** Upper skull + antlers only

4. **Initial cleaning**
   - Scrape off large pieces of meat, tissue (rough cleaning)
   - **DO NOT fully clean in field** (attract predators, time-consuming, wait for home/shop)

**Transport:**
- Wrap skull in game bag or cheesecloth (protect from flies, debris)
- Secure antlers (wrap tips, prevent damage)
- **Keep cool** (place in shade, pack with ice if available)

---

**OPTION B: SKULL PLATE REMOVAL (Antlers + Small Skull Section)**

**When to use:**
- Want antlers only (no full skull)
- Less weight to transport
- Simpler cleaning process

**How to remove skull plate:**
1. **Locate cutting lines**
   - Skull plate = top of skull where antlers attach (frontal bone)
   - Cut lines: Start behind eye sockets, angle UP toward antler bases
   - **Goal:** Include 4-6 inches of skull around each antler base (ensure attachment is secure)

2. **Saw through skull**
   - Use bone saw (or axe if careful)
   - Cut from behind each eye socket, angling up and back
   - Meet cuts behind antlers
   - **Result:** Skull plate (triangular piece of bone) with both antlers attached

3. **Clean skull plate**
   - Remove brain tissue from underside (scrape or rinse)
   - Trim excess meat, tissue
   - **Leave skull plate THICK** (thin plate = weak, antlers may detach later)

**Transport:**
- Skull plate is lighter, easier to pack than full skull
- Wrap antlers (protect tips)
- **Disadvantage:** Less flexibility (cannot do European mount, only skull plate displays)

---

### **TRANSPORT AND STORAGE (Field to Home/Shop)**

**IMMEDIATE CONCERNS (First 24 hours):**

**1. PREVENT HIDE SPOILAGE (if keeping hide):**
- **Temperature:** Keep below 50°F if possible (bacterial growth slows)
- **Salt:** Apply salt to hide interior (preservative, draws moisture)
- **Airflow:** Hang skull/hide where air circulates (prevents moisture buildup)

**2. PREVENT ANTLER DAMAGE:**
- Wrap tips (cloth, leather, bubble wrap)
- Secure antlers to prevent bouncing (against vehicle sides, other cargo)
- **DO NOT stack heavy items on antlers** (can break tines, crack beams)

**3. KEEP CLEAN:**
- Avoid mud, dirt (difficult to remove once dried)
- Keep away from blood/guts (staining)
- **If skull/plate gets dirty:** Rinse with water (brief rinse, don't soak)

**TRANSPORT DURATION:**

**Short trips (1-3 days):**
- Skull/plate wrapped in game bag
- Keep cool (pack with ice if available, store in coolest part of vehicle)
- Minimal spoilage risk

**Long trips (4-10 days):**
- **MUST preserve hide** (salt heavily, OR remove hide and take skull only)
- Skull can handle longer trips (bone doesn't spoil quickly)
- Check daily for odor, fly activity (indicates spoilage, need faster processing)

**Very long trips (10+ days):**
- **Remove hide** (take skull only, hide will spoil unless professionally salted/stored)
- Skull can be rough-cleaned in field (remove brain, eyes, major tissue)
- Wrap in breathable material (cheesecloth, game bag, NOT plastic)
- **Plastic bags = moisture trap = mold, rot**

---

### **PREVENTING SPOILAGE AND DAMAGE**

**HIDE SPOILAGE (if shoulder mount planned):**

**Symptoms:**
- Foul odor (rotting flesh, bacteria)
- Hair slippage (rub hand on hide, hair falls out = RUINED)
- Green/black discoloration (bacterial growth = hide is compromised)

**Prevention:**
- **Salt immediately** (within 6-12 hours of harvest)
- **Keep cool** (<50°F)
- **Get to taxidermist within 3 days** (or freeze)

**Recovery (if caught early):**
- Heavy salting (5-10 lbs salt, cover entire hide interior)
- Hang to dry (airflow)
- **MAY save hide if hair isn't slipping yet**

**ANTLER DAMAGE:**

**Common damage types:**
- Broken tips (fragile, impact damage)
- Cracked beams (stress cracks, impact)
- Gouges/scratches (abrasion, rubbing against hard surfaces)

**Prevention:**
- Wrap tips (padding)
- Secure antlers (no bouncing, shifting)
- Handle by skull/plate, NOT by antlers (antlers are fragile, can snap at base)

**Minor repairs possible:**
- Broken tips: Glue back on (epoxy, nearly invisible if clean break)
- Scratches: Sand, polish (minor surface damage only)
- **Major damage (cracked beams, missing sections): Significantly reduces value (-20-50%)**

## SECTION IV: TROPHY PREPARATION METHODS

### **EUROPEAN MOUNT (SKULL CLEANING METHODS)**

**EUROPEAN MOUNT = Cleaned skull + antlers, mounted on plaque or stand**

**Advantages:**
- Lower cost than shoulder mount (100-200 gp vs taxidermy 400-800 gp)
- Shows antler structure clearly (no hide obscures)
- Easier to display (smaller, plaque-mounted OR freestanding)
- **Popular for serious hunters (display multiple trophies, room-efficient)**

**THREE CLEANING METHODS:**

---

**METHOD 1: BEETLE CLEANING (BEST QUALITY, PROFESSIONAL)**

**Process:**
1. Remove hide, eyes, brain, tongue (rough cleaning)
2. Place skull in beetle colony box
   - **Dermestid beetles** (flesh-eating beetles) consume all soft tissue
   - Beetles eat ONLY meat, leave bone untouched (perfect cleaning)
3. Monitor progress (1-3 weeks depending on skull size, beetle colony size)
4. Remove skull when clean (all meat gone, only bone remains)

**Advantages:**
- **BEST METHOD** (cleanest result, no bone damage)
- Beetles don't damage delicate nasal bones (boiling can collapse these)
- No odor (beetles consume tissue, no rot)
- **Used by professional taxidermists, museums**

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires beetle colony (home beetle colonies = difficult, expensive)
- **Must send to professional** (most hunters don't have beetles)
- Cost: 80-150 gp (professional beetle cleaning)
- Time: 2-4 weeks (beetles work slowly, thorough)

**AVAILABILITY:**
- Major cities: Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Silverymoon (multiple beetle cleaning services)
- Frontier towns: Limited (may require shipping skull to city)

---

**METHOD 2: BOILING (FAST, DIY, MODERATE QUALITY)**

**Process:**
1. Remove hide, eyes, brain, tongue (rough cleaning)
2. **Prepare boiling setup:**
   - Large pot (skull must be fully submerged)
   - Water + soap (dish soap OR borax, helps degrease)
   - Heat source (outdoor fire, large stove)

3. **Boil skull:**
   - Submerge skull in boiling water
   - **DO NOT boil antlers** (can discolor, weaken antler base connection)
   - Use rope or wire to hold skull in water, antlers OUT of water
   - Boil 2-4 hours (depending on size)

4. **Clean skull:**
   - Remove from water every 30-60 minutes
   - Scrape off softened tissue (use knife, wire brush, pressure washer)
   - Return to water, continue boiling
   - **Repeat until all meat removed**

5. **Degrease:**
   - After meat removed, skull still contains fat (yellowish, greasy)
   - Soak in warm water + degreaser (dish soap, ammonia, commercial degreaser)
   - Change water daily, soak 5-10 days
   - **Fat will leach out into water** (water turns cloudy, yellowish)

**Advantages:**
- DIY (can do at home with basic equipment)
- Fast (2-4 hours boiling + 5-10 days degreasing = 1-2 weeks total)
- Low cost (0-20 gp for supplies)

**Disadvantages:**
- **Risk of damaging skull:**
  - Over-boiling = bones soften, can crack
  - Nasal bones can collapse (delicate structure)
  - Antler base can loosen (weakens connection to skull)
- **Odor:** Boiling meat/skull = VERY strong smell (do OUTDOORS only)
- **Labor-intensive:** Scraping, monitoring, repeated boiling/scraping cycles

**BEST PRACTICES:**
- Boil gently (simmer, not rolling boil)
- Monitor closely (don't over-boil)
- Keep antlers OUT of water (use support system)
- **If unsure, PAY PROFESSIONAL** (ruined skull cannot be fixed)

---

**METHOD 3: NATURAL DECOMPOSITION (SLOWEST, FREE, LOWEST QUALITY)**

**Process:**
1. Remove hide, eyes, brain, tongue
2. **Place skull in:
   - Wire mesh cage (protects from scavengers)
   - Outdoor location (away from house, smells bad)
   - **Let nature clean:** Bacteria, insects, weather degrade soft tissue over months

3. **Wait:** 6-12 months (depending on climate)
4. **Retrieve skull:** Once naturally cleaned
5. **Final cleaning:**
   - Scrape remaining debris
   - Pressure wash
   - Degrease (soak as per boiling method)

**Advantages:**
- Free (no equipment, no cost)
- No risk of damaging skull (no boiling, no chemicals)

**Disadvantages:**
- **VERY SLOW:** 6-12 months (unacceptable for most hunters)
- **Odor:** Rotting skull smells terrible (must be FAR from habitation)
- **Unpredictable:** Weather, scavengers, insects can damage skull
- **Seasonal:** Doesn't work in winter (freezing temps = no decomposition)

**WHEN TO USE:**
- Practice skulls (not valuable trophies)
- Extreme budget constraints
- No rush (willing to wait a year)

---

### **WHITENING AND PRESERVATION**

**AFTER CLEANING (any method):**

**Skull appears yellowish, greasy, dull = MUST whiten and preserve**

**WHITENING PROCESS:**

**1. FINAL DEGREASE (if needed):**
- Soak in degreaser (ammonia OR commercial degreaser) for 3-7 days
- Change water daily (until water stays clear = fat fully removed)

**2. HYDROGEN PEROXIDE WHITENING:**
- **Use 3-12% hydrogen peroxide** (NOT bleach, bleach damages bone)
- Submerge skull in peroxide (antlers OUT, peroxide can discolor)
- **OR** paint peroxide onto skull with brush (more control, less waste)
- **Soak time:** 12-24 hours (check every 6 hours)
- **Result:** Skull turns bright white (bone color lightens dramatically)

**3. RINSE AND DRY:**
- Rinse skull thoroughly (remove all peroxide)
- Air dry 2-3 days (fully dry before sealing)

**4. SEAL (OPTIONAL):**
- Spray clear matte sealant (protects from yellowing, moisture)
- **DO NOT use glossy sealant** (unnatural appearance)
- Light coat (1-2 passes, don't over-apply)

**PRESERVATION:**

**Treated skulls last indefinitely if stored properly:**
- Keep dry (humidity = yellowing, mold)
- Avoid direct sunlight (UV fades bone, yellows over time)
- Dust regularly (prevents buildup)

---

## SECTION V: MOUNTING TECHNIQUES

### **SHOULDER MOUNT SPECIFICATIONS**

**SHOULDER MOUNT = Full head taxidermy (hide, skull form, antlers)**

**COMPONENTS:**
1. **Antlers:** Real antlers from harvested animal
2. **Skull form:** Foam or synthetic form (replaces real skull)
3. **Hide:** Tanned hide from animal (OR replica hide if damaged)
4. **Eyes:** Glass eyes (realistic, custom-colored)
5. **Nose/Ears:** Detailed sculpting, realistic texture

**TAXIDERMY PROCESS (Professional, 4-8 months):**

**1. INITIAL CONSULTATION (Week 1):**
- Client brings skull + cape (hide + antlers)
- Taxidermist assesses quality:
  - Hide condition (hair intact? Properly preserved?)
  - Antler condition (broken points? Needs repair?)
  - Skull measurements (selects correct form size)
- Client selects:
  - **Mount style:** Upright, looking left/right, bugling/calling pose
  - **Habitat base:** Plaque only OR diorama (with vegetation, rocks)

**2. HIDE PREPARATION (Weeks 1-4):**
- Flesh hide (remove all meat, fat from interior)
- Tan hide (preserve, soften, prevent rot)
- Fit hide to foam form (stretch, pin, adjust)

**3. SKULL FORM AND ANTLERS (Weeks 2-6):**
- Select pre-made foam form (matches skull measurements)
- Attach antlers to form:
  - **Option A:** Attach real skull plate to form
  - **Option B:** Remove antlers from skull, mount directly to form
- Secure antlers (bolts, epoxy, very strong attachment)

**4. HIDE MOUNTING (Weeks 4-8):**
- Stretch hide over form
- Sew seams (back of head, neck seam)
- Sculpt details (nose, ears, eyes, mouth)
- **THIS STEP = ARTISTRY** (quality taxidermist vs amateur shows here)

**5. DRYING AND FINISHING (Weeks 8-16):**
- Hide dries slowly (shrinks to fit form)
- Taxidermist checks, adjusts (resculpt, fix wrinkles)
- Install eyes (glass eyes, realistic color)
- Final detailing (airbrush shading, whiskers, fine touches)

**6. MOUNTING ON PLAQUE/BASE:**
- Attach finished mount to wooden plaque OR habitat base
- Add nameplate (optional): Species, date, location, hunter name
- **Deliver to client**

---

### **TAXIDERMY SELECTION AND PRICING**

**CHOOSING A TAXIDERMIST:**

**Quality indicators:**
1. **Portfolio:** View previous work (mounts should look ALIVE, not stiff/fake)
2. **References:** Ask other hunters (satisfied customers?)
3. **Turnaround time:** 6-12 months typical (faster = may sacrifice quality)
4. **Specialization:** Cervine specialist preferred (not all taxidermists are equal)
5. **Awards:** Competition wins (state/regional taxidermy competitions)

**RED FLAGS:**
- Promises <6 month turnaround (unrealistic for quality work)
- No portfolio (can't show previous work = inexperienced)
- Won't provide references (hiding bad reputation)
- Price significantly below market (cheap = poor quality)

**PRICING (Professional Taxidermy):**

| Species | Shoulder Mount Cost | Factors |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| **Giant Elk** | 600-1,200 gp | Size (massive forms expensive), complexity |
| **Moose** | 500-900 gp | Large, palmated antlers (difficult to mount) |
| **Wapiti** | 400-700 gp | Standard large game, common (taxidermists experienced) |
| **Red Deer** | 350-600 gp | Medium size, standard |
| **Caribou** | 350-600 gp | Unique antlers (both sexes), interesting |
| **Whitetail/Mule** | 300-500 gp | Most common, many taxidermists (competitive pricing) |
| **Roe Deer** | 350-550 gp | Small, delicate (requires skill) |

**PRICING FACTORS:**
- **Size:** Larger animals = more expensive (bigger forms, more hide to tan)
- **Pose:** Complex poses (bugling, aggressive) = +15-30% (more sculpting)
- **Habitat base:** Diorama (rocks, vegetation, snow) = +50-150 gp
- **Rush service:** <6 months = +30-50% premium
- **Repairs:** Broken antlers, damaged hide = +50-200 gp (fix before mounting)

---

### **DISPLAY CONSIDERATIONS**

**MOUNTING LOCATION:**

**Optimal locations:**
1. **Trophy room** (dedicated space, multiple mounts)
2. **Great hall** (large open space, centerpiece display)
3. **Office/study** (personal space, conversation piece)
4. **Above fireplace mantle** (classic, prominent)

**AVOID:**
- Bathrooms (humidity = mold, hide deterioration)
- Kitchens (grease, smoke = discoloration)
- Direct sunlight (UV fades hide, bleaches antlers)
- Damp basements (mold, moisture damage)

**WALL STRENGTH:**

**Mount weights:**
| Species | Mount Weight | Wall Support Required |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Giant Elk** | 80-150 lbs | HEAVY-DUTY (wall studs, multiple bolts) |
| **Moose** | 60-100 lbs | HEAVY-DUTY |
| **Wapiti** | 40-70 lbs | Moderate-Heavy (wall studs) |
| **Whitetail** | 25-40 lbs | Moderate (drywall anchors acceptable) |
| **Roe Deer** | 15-25 lbs | Light (standard hanging) |

**INSTALLATION:**
- **DO NOT use drywall anchors** for large mounts (will fail, mount falls = damage)
- **Find wall studs** (wooden beams in wall, provide strong support)
- **Use lag bolts** (heavy-duty screws, 3-4 inch minimum)
- **Consider professional installation** (especially Giant Elk, Moose = very heavy)

---

### **ALTERNATIVE MOUNT STYLES**

**EUROPEAN MOUNT (Skull + Antlers, No Hide):**
- **Cost:** 100-250 gp (cleaning + mounting on plaque)
- **Display:** Wall-mounted plaque OR freestanding pedestal
- **Advantages:** Lower cost, shows antler structure clearly, easier to transport
- **Popular for:** Hunters with many trophies (room-efficient), modern aesthetic

**ANTLER CHANDELIER:**
- **Cost:** 400-1,200 gp (antler collection + crafting + electrical wiring)
- **Materials:** Multiple shed antlers OR harvested antlers (8-15 antlers typical)
- **Display:** Ceiling-mounted, functional lighting
- **Popular for:** Hunting lodges, taverns, noble estates (rustic elegance)

**FULL BODY MOUNT:**
- **Cost:** 1,500-5,000 gp (extremely expensive, full-size form + hide)
- **Display:** Freestanding (requires significant floor space)
- **Rarely done for cervines** (too large, too expensive, shoulder mounts more practical)
- **Exceptions:** Record-class trophies, museums, exceptionally wealthy patrons

**ANTLER DISPLAY (Antlers Only, No Skull):**
- **Cost:** 50-150 gp (mount antlers on shield-shaped plaque)
- **Process:** Remove antlers from skull plate, bolt to decorative plaque
- **Advantages:** Very compact, focuses on antlers only
- **Disadvantages:** Looks incomplete (no skull context), less impressive

---

## SECTION VI: SHED HUNTING MASTERY

### **SHED LOCATION STRATEGIES**

**SHED HUNTING = Searching for naturally-shed antlers (dropped in late winter/early spring)**

**WHY SHED HUNT:**
- **No kill required:** Antlers regenerate annually (sustainable harvest)
- **Low cost:** Just walking/searching (0 gp expedition cost)
- **Low risk:** No dangerous animals (unless encounter live bulls)
- **Legal:** No permits required (found objects)
- **Valuable:** Shed antlers worth 60-80% of harvested antlers

**CHALLENGES:**
- **Hard to find:** Forest is large, antlers are small (even Giant Elk antlers = needle in haystack)
- **Competition:** Other shed hunters, rodents/deer chew antlers (calcium source)
- **Low success rate:** May search days/weeks before finding single antler

---

**WHERE TO SEARCH (Highest probability areas):**

**1. WINTER FEEDING AREAS:**
- Bulls congregate in areas with accessible food (winter yards)
- **Look for:** Trampled snow, browse lines (branches eaten to same height), concentrated tracks
- **Why bulls shed here:** Spend most time feeding (antlers drop when bulls are stationary)

**2. BEDDING SITES:**
- Bulls bed down in sheltered areas (out of wind, thermal cover)
- **Look for:** Oval depressions in snow/grass (body-sized), concentrated scat
- **Why bulls shed here:** Antlers drop when bulls stand up from bed (leverage = pops antler off)

**3. TRAILS AND TRAVEL CORRIDORS:**
- Bulls walk same trails repeatedly (habit, least resistance)
- **Look for:** Well-worn paths, tracks, scat along trails
- **Why bulls shed here:** Antlers drop while walking (jostling movement dislodges antler)

**4. WATER SOURCES:**
- Bulls visit streams, rivers, ponds (daily water needs)
- **Look for:** Tracks converging on water, muddy banks
- **Why bulls shed here:** Daily visits = high traffic = higher probability

**5. OBSTACLES AND JUMP-OVERS:**
- Fences, fallen logs, streams (bulls jump over)
- **Landing impact = antlers jar loose**
- **Check both sides:** Antler may drop on takeoff OR landing

---

**WHEN TO SEARCH (Timing is critical):**

**OPTIMAL SHED HUNTING SEASON:**
| Phase | Months (Harptos) | Conditions | Success Rate |
|-------|------------------|------------|--------------|
| **Too Early** | Nightal - Early Alturiak | Bulls still have antlers | 0% (no sheds yet) |
| **Peak Shedding** | Late Alturiak - Ches | Bulls actively shedding | HIGH (but snow may cover) |
| **Best Searching** | Ches - Mirtul | Snow melted, antlers visible | BEST (70-80% of sheds found) |
| **Late Season** | Kythorn - Eleasis | Vegetation overgrown | LOW (sheds hidden by plants) |
| **Too Late** | Eleint onward | Sheds chewed by rodents/deer | VERY LOW (damaged/destroyed) |

**IDEAL TIMING:** **Ches - Mirtul** (early-mid spring)
- Snow melted (sheds visible on ground)
- Vegetation not yet overgrown (clear visibility)
- Sheds not yet damaged (chewing begins in late spring)

---

### **GLASSING AND SEARCHING TECHNIQUES**

**GLASSING (Using optics from distance):**

**Equipment:**
- Binoculars (10x42 OR 10x50) OR spotting scope (20-60x)
- **Look for:** White/brown objects on ground (antlers stand out against forest floor)

**Glassing technique:**
1. Find elevated position (hilltop, ridge)
2. **Glass open areas first:** Meadows, fields, clear-cuts (easiest to spot antlers)
3. Systematic search (grid pattern, don't skip sections)
4. **Look for antler tips:** Tines stick up, catch eye (main beam may be hidden in grass)

**Advantages:**
- Cover large areas quickly (scan hundreds of acres from one position)
- Less physical effort (no hiking into every thicket)

**Disadvantages:**
- **Only works in open areas** (can't glass dense forest)
- Easy to miss (antlers blend in, especially if lying flat)

---

**GROUND SEARCHING (Walking and looking):**

**Technique:**
1. Walk slowly (1-2 mph, can't search effectively at hiking speed)
2. **Look down AND ahead:** Alternate focus (near ground vs 20-30 yards ahead)
3. Look for **white tips, brown beams, unnatural shapes**
4. **Check obvious spots:**
   - Base of trees (bulls rub trees, antlers may drop nearby)
   - Near rub trees (visible bark damage = bull was here)
   - Fences, jump-overs (impact dislodges antlers)

**Search pattern:**
- Zig-zag (cover ground thoroughly, don't walk straight lines)
- Focus on high-probability areas (feed areas, bedding, trails)

**What sheds look like on ground:**
- **Color:** White (fresh, sun-bleached) OR brown (stained, older)
- **Position:** Usually lying on side (not upright)
- **Visibility:** Tines stick up (catch eye), main beam hidden in grass

---

### **MATCHED PAIR IDENTIFICATION**

**MATCHED PAIR = Both antlers (left + right) from SAME bull, found within days/weeks**

**VALUE:**
- **Matched pair worth 2.5-3x single antler** (rarity premium)
- **Example:** Single Giant Elk shed = 80-180 gp, Matched pair = 200-400 gp

**WHY RARE:**
- Bulls shed antlers 24-72 hours apart (but may walk miles between sheds)
- Other shed hunters may find one side (you find the other = incomplete pair)
- Rodents/deer chew sheds (one side destroyed before you find it)
- **Finding BOTH sides = rare luck OR systematic searching**

**HOW TO FIND MATCHED PAIRS:**

**1. WHEN YOU FIND FIRST SHED:**
- **STOP, mark location** (GPS, landmark)
- **Search intensely in 50-100 yard radius** (other side likely nearby)
- Bulls often shed in same general area (feeding, bedding)

**2. SEARCH PATTERN:**
- Circle outward from first shed (start 20 yards, expand to 50, then 100)
- Check trails (bull may have walked after shedding first side)
- **Time invested:** 30-60 minutes (worth it if find match)

**3. MATCHING CONFIRMATION:**
- **Size match:** Both antlers similar spread, beam length, point count
- **Wear match:** Same degree of weathering (sun-bleached, chewing, both fresh OR both old)
- **Growth pattern:** Point configuration matches (left/right mirror image)
- **Pedicle fit:** Base shape matches (if unsure, bases should "mate" when held together)

**SUCCESS RATE:**
- **Amateur shed hunters:** 5-10% find matched pairs (most find singles)
- **Experienced shed hunters:** 15-25% matched (systematic searching, patience)
- **Professional shed hunters:** 30-40% matched (know territory, bulls, daily searching)

---

### **FRAUD DETECTION AND AUTHENTICATION**

**COMMON FRAUD TYPES:**

**1. POINT FABRICATION (Adding fake points):**
- **Method:** Carve wood/bone, glue to antler, stain to match
- **Detection:**
  - Inspect base of each point (fake points = glue seam visible)
  - Flex point (real bone = rigid, fake = may flex)
  - Check grain (real antler = consistent bone grain, fake = wood grain OR no grain)

**2. SPREAD AUGMENTATION (Artificially widening spread):**
- **Method:** Heat antlers, bend outward, cool (sets new shape)
- **Detection:**
  - Check pedicle angle (if bent, attachment angle doesn't match beam angle = unnatural)
  - Look for stress cracks (bending causes micro-cracks in bone)
  - Measure symmetry (forced bending usually makes antlers asymmetric)

**3. CIRCUMFERENCE ENHANCEMENT (Adding material to beams):**
- **Method:** Apply putty/epoxy to beams, sand smooth, stain
- **Detection:**
  - Scrape small area (putty = soft, real bone = hard)
  - Check for seams (putty edges may separate from real bone)
  - X-ray (putty shows different density than bone)

**4. POINT COUNT MANIPULATION (Counting sub-1-inch points):**
- **Method:** Claim small bumps (<1 inch) as points
- **Detection:** Measure every point (Guild scorers measure, don't accept verbal claims)

**AUTHENTICATION TECHNIQUES:**

**Visual inspection:**
- Examine all points (look for glue, color mismatch, fake grain)
- Check pedicle (attachment should be natural, not forced)
- Inspect symmetry (natural vs. artificial alterations)

**Physical testing:**
- **Flex test:** Try to bend points (real = rigid, fake = may flex)
- **Scrape test:** Small scrape on interior (real bone = hard, putty = soft)
- **Weight test:** Fake antlers often lighter (wood, foam = less dense than bone)

**Advanced (if suspected fraud):**
- **X-ray:** Shows internal structure (bone = consistent density, fake = voids, different material)
- **UV light:** Some glues/epoxies fluoresce under UV (reveals alterations)

**PENALTIES FOR FRAUD:**
- Lifetime ban from Guild certification
- Fine: 100-500 gp
- Confiscation of trophy (destroyed OR kept as "fraud example")
- Public disclosure (name published in fraud registry, reputation destroyed)

**RARE FRAUD (but happens):**
- Dishonest hunters attempt fraud (increase trophy value)
- **Professional taxidermists NEVER commit fraud** (lose license, livelihood)
- **Guild scorers trained to detect** (fraud rate <1% of submissions)

### **AUCTION VS PRIVATE SALE**

**AUCTION (Waterdeep, Neverwinter auction houses):**

**Advantages:**
- **Competitive bidding:** May drive price above market (if multiple bidders)
- **Exposure:** Wealthy buyers attend auctions (find buyers you wouldn't otherwise)
- **Transparency:** Public sale, documented price (good for provenance)

**Disadvantages:**
- **Auction house fees:** 15-25% commission (auction house takes cut)
- **Minimum reserve:** Set minimum price (if bids don't meet reserve, no sale)
- **Risk of low turnout:** If few bidders, price may be low

**When to auction:**
- **Record-class trophies** (highest value, competitive bidding drives price up)
- **Unique/historic trophies** (Bjorn Thunderaxe's Giant Elk = auction material)
- **Multiple buyers expected** (demand > supply = auction maximizes value)

**Expected prices (auction vs market):**
- **Record trophies:** +20-50% above private sale (competitive bidding)
- **Common trophies:** +0-15% (limited bidding, auction fees offset gains)

---

**PRIVATE SALE (Direct to buyer, Guild-brokered):**

**Advantages:**
- **No commission:** Keep 100% of sale price (no auction house cut)
- **Negotiation:** Can set price, negotiate directly
- **Speed:** Immediate sale (no waiting for auction date)

**Disadvantages:**
- **Limited exposure:** Fewer potential buyers (miss out on competitive bidding)
- **Pricing uncertainty:** Hard to know fair market value (no competitive bids for reference)

**When to sell privately:**
- **Common-Good class trophies** (not rare enough for auction)
- **Quick sale needed** (need cash immediately)
- **Known buyer** (dwarf collector, noble acquaintance)

**Expected prices:**
- **Good trophies:** Market value (fair deal, no premium)
- **Common trophies:** Slight discount (-10-20% to move quickly)

---

### **INVESTMENT POTENTIAL**

**APPRECIATING ASSETS:**
- **Record-class trophies:** Appreciate 3-5% per year (scarcity increases over time)
- **Historic trophies:** Appreciate faster (10-20% per year, famous hunters = collectible)
- **Example:** Bjorn Thunderaxe's Giant Elk (1473 DR) was worth ~500 gp at harvest, today (1495 DR) worth 3,000-5,000 gp = 500-900% appreciation over 22 years

**STABLE ASSETS:**
- **Trophy-class (non-record):** Hold value, appreciate slowly (~1-2% per year)
- **Good-class:** Hold value, minimal appreciation

**DEPRECIATING ASSETS:**
- **Common-class:** May depreciate slightly (supply increases, demand steady = prices flat/down)
- **Damaged trophies:** Depreciate over time (condition worsens = value decreases)

**INVESTMENT STRATEGY (for wealthy collectors):**
- **Buy record-class trophies early** (before fame, historic significance recognized)
- **Hold 10-20 years** (scarcity + fame = value increases)
- **Sell at auction** (maximize return)

**Example:** Buy record Wapiti trophy today (800 gp), hold 15 years, sell at auction for 1,200-1,600 gp = 50-100% return (3-5% annual appreciation)

---

## SECTION IX: CARE, MAINTENANCE, AND RESTORATION

### **CLEANING MOUNTED TROPHIES**

**ROUTINE CLEANING (Monthly-Quarterly):**

**Shoulder mounts (hide + antlers):**
1. **Dust weekly:** Soft brush OR feather duster (remove dust from hide, antlers)
2. **Vacuum quarterly:** Use brush attachment on low setting (avoid pulling hair)
3. **Spot clean:** Damp cloth for stains (water only, NO chemicals)
4. **Antlers:** Wipe with dry cloth (antlers don't need cleaning, just dust removal)

**European mounts (skull + antlers):**
1. **Dust weekly:** Soft brush (remove dust from skull crevices)
2. **Wipe skull:** Damp cloth (water only, remove fingerprints, smudges)
3. **Antlers:** Dry cloth (minimal care needed)

**AVOID:**
- **Harsh chemicals:** Bleach, ammonia, household cleaners (damage hide, discolor bone)
- **Water on hide:** Excessive moisture (can cause hide to rot, hair to slip)
- **Abrasive cloths:** Steel wool, rough brushes (scratch antlers, damage hide)

---

### **PREVENTING INSECT DAMAGE**

**THREATS:**

**1. CARPET BEETLES (Dermestid beetles):**
- **Damage:** Eat hide from inside out (larvae tunnel through hide, consume hair, leather)
- **Signs:** Small holes in hide, hair falling out, larvae visible (small, brown, worm-like)

**2. MOTHS:**
- **Damage:** Eat hair (larvae consume hair, leave bald patches)
- **Signs:** Bald spots, webbing on hide, moths flying near mount

**3. SILVERFISH:**
- **Damage:** Minor (eat dried tissue, minimal damage to modern mounts)
- **Signs:** Small, silver insects visible, rare in well-maintained homes

---

**PREVENTION:**

**1. CLIMATE CONTROL:**
- **Keep dry:** Humidity <50% (insects thrive in moisture)
- **Temperature:** Moderate (65-75°F), avoid extreme heat/cold fluctuations
- **Ventilation:** Good airflow (prevents moisture buildup)

**2. REGULAR INSPECTION:**
- **Check quarterly:** Look for holes, hair loss, insects
- **Catch early:** Small infestations easy to treat, large infestations = mount destroyed

**3. PREVENTIVE TREATMENTS:**
- **Mothballs:** Place near mount (repels moths, carpet beetles)
  - **USE CAUTION:** Toxic to pets, children (use in sealed display cases only)
- **Cedar:** Cedar chest OR cedar chips (natural repellent, mild)
- **Professional treatment:** Pesticide spray (taxidermist can apply during mounting)

---

**TREATMENT (If infestation detected):**

**Small infestation (caught early):**
1. **Isolate mount:** Remove from display, separate from other mounts
2. **Freeze:** Place in freezer (if possible, kills larvae/eggs, 72 hours minimum)
   - **Large mounts:** Not feasible (won't fit in freezer)
3. **Vacuum:** Remove visible insects, larvae (brush attachment)
4. **Insecticide:** Spray mount with appropriate pesticide (taxidermist-approved)
5. **Monitor:** Check weekly for 2-3 months (ensure infestation cleared)

**Large infestation:**
- **Professional treatment:** Contact taxidermist (may require fumigation, extensive cleaning)
- **May be irreversible:** Severe damage (hide eaten through, hair gone) cannot be fully repaired

---

### **UV PROTECTION AND FADING**

**UV DAMAGE:**
- **Hide fading:** Brown/tan hide bleaches to light tan/white (sun exposure)
- **Antler color loss:** Brown-stained antlers fade to grey/white
- **Hide brittleness:** UV breaks down hide proteins (becomes brittle, cracks)

**PREVENTION:**

**1. AVOID DIRECT SUNLIGHT:**
- **Do NOT mount near windows** (direct sun = rapid fading)
- **Use curtains/blinds:** If near windows, block sun during peak hours

**2. UV-PROTECTIVE GLASS:**
- **Display cases:** Use UV-filtering glass/acrylic (blocks 99% UV)
- **Cost:** +30-50% over regular glass (worth investment for valuable trophies)

**3. ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING:**
- **Use LED lights:** Low UV emission (vs incandescent/fluorescent = high UV)
- **Indirect lighting:** Light the room, not the mount directly

**REVERSAL (If fading occurs):**
- **Hide touch-up:** Professional taxidermist can airbrush faded areas (restore color)
- **Antler re-staining:** Can be darkened (stain, wood stain, coffee) if faded
- **Cost:** 50-150 gp (depending on extent of damage)

---

### **ANTLER REPAIR TECHNIQUES**

**COMMON DAMAGE:**

**1. BROKEN TIPS:**
- **Cause:** Impact (dropped, hit during transport, animal combat damage)
- **Repair:** Glue tip back on (if clean break)

**How to repair:**
1. Clean break surfaces (remove dust, dirt)
2. Apply epoxy glue (strong, waterproof)
3. Hold pieces together (2-5 minutes until epoxy sets)
4. Clamp OR tape (secure while glue cures, 24 hours)
5. Remove clamp, inspect (should be nearly invisible if clean break)

**Success rate:** 90%+ if clean break, nearly invisible repair

---

**2. CRACKED BEAMS:**
- **Cause:** Stress (impact, improper mounting, age)
- **Repair:** Fill crack with epoxy, stabilize

**How to repair:**
1. Clean crack (remove debris)
2. Apply thin epoxy OR bone glue (work into crack with toothpick)
3. Clamp crack closed (secure until glue dries)
4. Sand excess glue (smooth finish)
5. **Optional:** Stain repair (match antler color)

**Success rate:** 70-80%, visible repair but stabilizes crack (prevents further damage)

---

**3. MISSING SECTIONS:**
- **Cause:** Broken, lost piece (not recoverable)
- **Repair:** Carve replacement section (wood, bone, resin)

**How to repair (DIFFICULT, professional recommended):**
1. Carve replacement piece (match size, shape)
2. Attach with epoxy (strong bond)
3. Sand, shape (blend with real antler)
4. Stain (match color)

**Success rate:** 50-70%, visible repair (color/texture match imperfect)
**Cost:** 50-200 gp (professional carving, time-intensive)

---

**4. LOOSE ANTLER (Detached from skull/form):**
- **Cause:** Weak attachment, impact
- **Repair:** Re-attach with stronger hardware

**How to repair:**
1. Remove antler completely (if partially attached)
2. Drill new holes (skull plate OR foam form)
3. Use lag bolts (heavy-duty screws, 3-4 inch)
4. Apply epoxy around base (additional bonding)
5. Secure tightly (antler should not wobble)

**Success rate:** 95%+, stable repair

---

## SECTION X: CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### **UTHGARDT SACRED ANTLER TRADITIONS**

**BLUE BEAR TRIBE (Lurkwood):**

**Antler rituals:**
- **Sacred Hunt:** Giant Elk hunted only with shaman's blessing (prayer to Uthgar)
- **Antlers = Community property:** Mounted in tribal lodge (NOT personal trophy)
- **Chief's headdress:** Incorporates antler fragments (passed down through generations)

**Ceremony (Giant Elk harvest):**
1. **Pre-hunt blessing:** Shaman performs ritual (祈祷 to Uthgar, request success)
2. **Hunt:** 8-15 tribal hunters (communal effort, no outsiders)
3. **Post-harvest:** Entire tribe gathers, feast lasts 2 days
4. **Antler blessing:** Shaman blesses antlers (dedicates to Uthgar)
5. **Mounting:** Antlers hung in lodge (visible to all, reminder of Uthgar's favor)

**Beliefs:**
- Giant Elk = Uthgar's chosen beast (sacred, hunting is spiritual act)
- Antlers carry Uthgar's spirit (protect tribe, grant strength)
- **Selling antlers = TABOO** (sacrilege, curse on tribe)

---

**TREE GHOST TRIBE (High Forest):**

**Antler traditions:**
- **EXTREME rarity:** Hunt Giant Elk only in dire need (1 per 5-10 years)
- **Antlers = Chief's regalia:** Passed down through bloodline (200+ years of chiefs)
- **Sacred storage:** Antlers stored in secret grove (holy site, guarded)

**Beliefs:**
- Giant Elk spirits watch over forest (killing one = taking spirit guardian)
- **Must honor sacrifice:** Use ALL parts (meat, hide, bones, antlers)
- Hunters who kill without blessing = exiled (dishonor, spiritual corruption)

---

### **REGHED WARRIOR INITIATION (ICEWIND DALE)**

**TRIBE OF THE BEAR, TRIBE OF THE WOLF:**

**Coming-of-age ritual:**
- Young warriors (16-20 years old) must hunt Giant Elk (prove manhood)
- **Solo OR small group** (2-4 young warriors, no elders)
- Success = full warrior status, failure = shame (can retry)

**Trophy use:**
- **Antlers mounted on warrior's tent** (public display, announcement of success)
- **Warrior earns name:** "Bjorn Elk-Slayer," "Torgrim Antler-Taker," etc.
- **Hide = family heirloom:** Passed to eldest son (heritage)

**Social status:**
- **Successful hunters:** Eligible for tribal leadership, marriage, respect
- **Failed hunters:** Lower status (but can attempt again)
- **Older warriors (30+) with no Giant Elk:** Viewed as incomplete (social pressure)

**Statistics:**
- ~15-25 Giant Elk hunted per year (all Reghed tribes combined)
- Success rate: 30-40% (young, inexperienced hunters = lower success than professional)
- Fatality rate: 15-25% (higher than professional hunts, young hunters take more risks)

---

### **DWARVEN COLLECTING CULTURE (MIRABAR, CITADEL ADBAR)**

**WHY DWARVES COLLECT ANTLERS:**

**Cultural values:**
- **Craftsmanship:** Dwarves appreciate antler growth (bone sculpture, natural artistry)
- **Size/symmetry:** Aesthetic beauty (perfect symmetry = perfect form)
- **Surface dwellers' trophy:** Represents world above (exotic to subterranean dwarves)

**Display practices:**
- **Clan halls:** Central display (largest trophies, communal pride)
- **Private estates:** Trophy rooms (wealthy dwarves, personal collections)
- **Mirabar Hall of Hunters:** Museum (public display, largest collection in North)

**Collecting strategy:**
- **Commission hunts:** Hire professional human/half-orc rangers (dwarves rarely hunt themselves)
- **Purchase at auction:** Competitive bidding (wealthy dwarves bid against each other)
- **Trade for trophies:** Offer dwarven crafts (weapons, armor) in exchange for antlers

**Famous dwarven collections:**
- **Marchion Elastul Raurym (Mirabar):** 23 Giant Elk trophies (largest private collection)
- **Clan Ironforge (Citadel Adbar):** 15 Moose, 8 Giant Elk (clan hall display)
- **Mirabar Hall of Hunters:** 47 Giant Elk (including Bjorn's world record), 80+ other cervines

---

### **NOBLE TROPHY ROOMS (WATERDEEP, NEVERWINTER)**

**NOBLE TROPHY CULTURE:**

**Status symbol:**
- Trophy room = wealth display (hunting is expensive, trophies prove affordability)
- **Size matters:** Largest antlers = highest status (competitive among peers)
- **Collection diversity:** One of each species = completionist (bragging rights)

**Trophy room design:**
- **Dedicated room:** 15-30 ft × 20-40 ft (estate wing dedicated to hunting)
- **Wall-mounted:** All walls lined with trophies (10-30 mounts)
- **Centerpiece:** Largest trophy above fireplace mantle (focal point)
- **Lighting:** Dim, dramatic (spotlights on largest trophies)
- **Furniture:** Leather chairs, hunting lodge aesthetic

**Social function:**
- **Dinner parties:** Show guests trophy room (hunt stories, impress visitors)
- **Competition:** "Lord Neverember has 102-inch Giant Elk, but I have 108-inch" (one-upmanship)
- **Networking:** Hunting stories = bonding (business deals, alliances formed over shared interest)

**Famous noble trophy rooms:**
- **Lord Neverember (Neverwinter):** 12 mounts (including 106-inch Giant Elk)
- **Lord Piergeiron's estate (Waterdeep):** 18 mounts (diverse collection, all certified)
- **Silverhand estate (Waterdeep):** 8 mounts (focuses on quality over quantity, record-class only)

---

## CONCLUSION

Antler trophy mastery encompasses biology, scoring, preparation, display, and cultural significance. Key takeaways:

**BIOLOGY:**
- Antlers shed annually (late Alturiak-Early Ches)
- Regrow spring-summer (fastest-growing tissue, 1-2 inches/week)
- Velvet sheds mid-Eleint (ready for rut)
- Size determined by genetics (40-50%), age (30-35%), nutrition (20-25%)

**SCORING:**
- Guild of Hunters system (400 points max)
- Components: Spread (40%), beam (25%), points (20%), circumference (10%), symmetry (5%)
- Certification required for record eligibility, market premium

**PREPARATION:**
- European mount = skull + antlers, cleaned (beetle OR boiling)
- Shoulder mount = full taxidermy (400-1,200 gp, 6-12 months)
- Whitening with peroxide (NOT bleach)

**VALUE:**
- Trophy class: Common (base), Good (+30-60%), Trophy (+80-150%), Record (+150-400%)
- Certification: +20-40% premium
- Historic significance: +50-200%+ (famous hunters, record trophies)

**CARE:**
- Dust regularly, avoid sunlight (UV fading)
- Prevent insects (humidity control, mothballs)
