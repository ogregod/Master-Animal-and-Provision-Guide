## ABOUT THIS GUIDE

This is a professional reference for processing deer of Western Faerûn. Whether you're a frontier hunter field-dressing whitetail deer or an urban provisioner sourcing premium elk antlers, this guide provides the technical knowledge you need.

**What This Guide Covers:**
- **12 Natural Deer Breeds** - From common Sword Coast whitetail to legendary giant elk
- **Complete Processing Techniques** - Field dressing to retail fabrication
- **Antler Trophy System** - Point scoring, velvet harvest, mounting techniques
- **Lean Meat Specialization** - Venison processing without fat rendering
- **Rut Season Economics** - When to hunt for trophies vs meat quality
- **Age Class Management** - Fawn, yearling, mature, trophy-class selection
- **Preservation Mastery** - Smoking, jerky, summer sausage for lean meat
- **Trophy Preparation** - Antler racks, European mounts, full taxidermy

**What Makes Deer Unique:**
- **Antler Trophies:** Renewable resource (shed annually), worth 20-80% of total value depending on breed
- **Rut Season:** Marpenoth-Uktar breeding (bulls = poor meat quality, aggressive behavior)
- **Lean Meat:** 2-3% body fat (vs bear 8-10%, pork 15-25%) - ideal for jerky, requires special handling
- **Velvet Antlers:** Flamerule-Eleasis harvest (alchemical/medicinal, 8-120 gp/lb depending on species)
- **Age Classes:** Meat quality and antler size vary by age (yearling vs mature vs trophy)
- **Accessibility:** CR 0 to CR 2 (whitetail = easy, moose/giant elk = dangerous game)

## WHAT'S NOT COVERED

**Magical and Monstrous Cervine:**
This guide covers **natural deer only**. For magical creatures, see specialized references:
- **Perytons** - PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS: Do not process. Intelligent evil creatures (Guild ethics violation).
- **Dire Stags** - See *Master Butcher's Guide § Megafauna Processing* (CR 3-5, requires specialized techniques)
- **Werestags** - PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS: Do not process. Lycanthrope (Guild ethics violation).
- **Celestial/Fiendish Deer** - Requires specialized divine/infernal butchering certification
- **Feywild Variants Beyond This Guide** - This guide covers Moonlit Deer only (naturalized to Material Plane)

**Domestic Deer Farming:**
Western Faerûn has limited deer farming tradition (fallow deer velvet farms in Neverwinter, rare). Most deer in this guide are wild-caught game animals. For farm animal processing, see *Bovine of Western Faerûn* or *Porcine of Western Faerûn*.

## HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

### For Dungeon Masters

**Hunting Encounters:**
- Use breed CR ratings for encounter design (whitetail CR 0, giant elk CR 2)
- Field dressing DCs provided (Survival 8-18 depending on conditions)
- Processing timelines for wilderness survival scenarios (4-24 hours depending on size)
- Trophy value for reward calculations (antlers = 5 sp to 250 gp)

**Economic Worldbuilding:**
- Seasonal deer hunting (Eleint-Uktar harvest, Nightal-Alturiak scarcity)
- Frontier provisioning (smoked venison, jerky, winter rations)
- Trophy hunting culture (antler racks, noble estates, bragging rights)
- Velvet antler farming (Neverwinter fallow deer farms, alchemical trade)

**Regional Flavor:**
- Icewind Dale: Caribou migration economy (Reghed tribes, Ten-Towns survival)
- Moonshae Isles: Island elk hunting (Northlander permissions, tribal culture)
- High Moor: Wapiti herd hunting (expedition-based, 3-5 elk harvests)
- Spine of the World: Giant elk legends (legendary trophies, dangerous game)

### For Players

**Should We Process This Deer Ourselves?**

**Simple Answer:** If you killed it and have 4-16 hours, yes - it's profitable.

**Quick Economics (180 lb Whitetail):**
- Sell whole to butcher: 8-12 gp
- Process yourself (basic): 10-16 gp profit (6 hours labor)
- Process + preserve: 12-20 gp profit (22 hours labor)
- **Trophy antlers add:** +0.5-4 gp depending on points (8-point = +1.2-2 gp)

**What You Need:**
- **Skills:** Survival +2 or higher for field dressing
- **Tools:** Hunting knife, rope, salt (3 gp basic kit)
- **Time:** 30-60 minutes field dressing, 4-16 hours full processing (size dependent)
- **Preservation:** Smokehouse access or 8+ lbs salt for curing

**When to Just Sell the Whole Carcass:**
- In town (butcher available, no processing space)
- Time-critical quest (can't spare 4+ hours)
- Low Survival skill (risk spoilage, botched skinning = lost antler value)
- Small deer (< 80 lbs = marginal profit after labor, roe deer/fawns)

**When Processing Is Worth It:**
- Large deer (elk/moose 400+ lbs = significant profit, 60-120 gp total value)
- Trophy antlers (10+ points = premium racks worth 25-80 gp)
- Party has Survival expertise (efficient processing, no spoilage risk)
- Downtime available (between quests, extended camp)
- Smokehouse access (preserved venison = +30-50% profit)

## ANTLER VALUE AS % OF TOTAL

Understanding antler value helps prioritize hunting strategy:

**Low Antler Value (Meat Focus):**
- **Roe deer:** 15-25% (small antlers, focus on meat)
- **Caribou:** 20-30% (moderate antlers, meat + hide primary)

**Moderate Antler Value (Balanced):**
- **Whitetail:** 25-35% (8-point = balanced meat/trophy)
- **Mule deer:** 30-40% (bifurcated antlers, premium)
- **Red deer:** 35-45% (large racks, transitional)

**High Antler Value (Trophy Focus):**
- **Wapiti:** 40-55% (12-point trophy elk = antlers dominant)
- **Moose:** 45-60% (massive palmate antlers = major value)
- **Fey deer:** 50-70% (magical antlers = extreme premium)
- **Giant elk:** 60-80% (legendary 18-point racks = 180-250 gp alone)

**Strategy:** Hunt trophy-class bulls for antlers (accept poor meat), hunt does/cows for meat quality (no antlers but tender).

---

## CONSERVATION & ETHICS

**Professional Standards:**
- **Age class management:** Harvest yearlings/mature bucks, protect trophy genetics
- **Sex ratios:** Maintain 3-5 does per buck (population health)
- **Fawn protection:** Do not harvest spotted fawns (< 1 year, illegal most regions)
- **Rut respect:** Do not hunt bedded/resting bulls (ethical fair chase)
- **Wounded tracking:** Track and recover wounded deer (prevent waste, ethical obligation)

**Regional Regulations:**
- **Cormyr:** Royal hunting preserves (permits required, 50-200 gp)
- **Neverwinter:** Fallow deer parks protected (noble property, trespass = crime)
- **Moonshae:** Northlander tribal quotas (permissions required, respect Fffolk/Northlander rights)
- **Icewind Dale:** Reghed caribou hunting rights (tribal territories, avoid conflict)

**Population Management:**
- **Overpopulation:** Harvest does to reduce herd (crop damage, starvation prevention)
- **Trophy management:** Cull old/inferior bulls (improve genetics, make room for prime bucks)
- **Migration corridors:** Respect traditional routes (caribou, elk migrations)

---

## TERMINOLOGY

## PROFESSIONAL PERSPECTIVE

*"Deer are not small bears. They're lean, fast, and require completely different processing techniques. No fat to render means you focus on meat quality - dry aging, proper moisture retention, and preservation that doesn't dry them out further. Master the whitetail first - it's forgiving, common, and teaches you the fundamentals. Then scale up to elk and moose when you understand lean meat handling. The antlers are bonus profit, but the real skill is in keeping venison tender and flavorful."*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher, 132 years experience**

*"Velvet antler harvest is where knowledge pays. A Flamerule-harvested elk velvet rack can be worth more than the entire processed meat yield. But timing is everything - wait too long and the velvet hardens, wait too little and you lose growth potential. This is why Neverwinter's fallow deer farms profit - controlled velvet harvest, annual renewable income, zero hunting cost. Learn the calendar, learn the anatomy, learn the alchemical market."*

**— Helena Fairstock, Master Provisioner, 32 years experience**
