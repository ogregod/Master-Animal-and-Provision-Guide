---

## I. BREED OVERVIEW

### The Transitional Cervine

Red deer occupy the **middle ground** between common deer (whitetail 150 lbs, mule deer 200 lbs) and true elk (wapiti 700 lbs, moose 1,200 lbs). They are **too large to be "common"** but **too small to require expeditions** like elk/moose.

**KEY CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Size:** 250-400 lbs (67-167% larger than whitetail, 58-75% smaller than elk)
- **Retail Yield:** 90-130 lbs (75-150% more than whitetail, 55-70% less than elk)
- **Processing:** Same 7 primals as whitetail (scales up, but techniques identical)
- **Challenge Rating:** 1/8 (mild danger during rut, unlike CR 0 whitetail or CR 1/2 moose)
- **Expedition:** NOT required (2-4 day hunts vs elk 5-15 days)
- **Market Position:** "Premium common deer" OR "Accessible elk substitute"

**PRACTICAL MEANING:** Red deer provide **bulk venison without expedition costs**. A single red deer yields as much meat as 2-3 whitetails (90-130 lbs vs 52 lbs per whitetail), making them attractive for:
- **Large Families:** One deer = 2-3 months of meat
- **Group Purchases:** 2-4 families split one red deer
- **Feast Preparation:** Noble houses, temples (one red deer serves 15-20 people)
- **Bulk Processors:** Taverns, institutions (fewer deer = less processing labor)

---

## II. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

### Primary Range

**TRIELTA HILLS (Core Population - Named Range):**
- **Southern Trielta Hills:** 1,500-2,500 individuals (closest to Waterdeep, 4-6 days)
- **Central Trielta Hills:** 1,000-1,800 individuals (Dragon Coast borderlands)
- **Northern Trielta Hills:** 800-1,500 individuals (transitions to Sunset Mountains)
- **Total Trielta:** 3,300-5,800 individuals (most dense population)

**SECONDARY RANGE:**
- **Sunset Mountains (Foothills):** 1,200-2,000 individuals (western slopes, 3,000-5,000 ft)
- **Troll Hills:** 600-1,200 individuals (scattered, limited habitat)
- **Starspire Mountains (Southern):** 400-800 individuals (isolated populations)

**MARGINAL RANGE:**
- **High Forest (Southern Edges):** 200-400 individuals (overlap with mule deer, rare)
- **Graypeak Mountains (Lowlands):** 300-600 individuals (transitional zones only)

**TOTAL POPULATION:** 6,000-11,000 individuals (less abundant than whitetail/mule deer, more common than exotic species)

---

### Market Access

**NEAREST MAJOR MARKETS:**
- **Waterdeep:** 4-7 days (Trielta Hills to Waterdeep, chilled wagon required for fresh meat)
- **Baldur's Gate:** 3-6 days (southern Trielta Hills, coastal routes)
- **Berdusk:** 2-4 days (northern Trielta Hills, Sunset Mountains, closest access)
- **Athkatla (Amn):** 5-9 days (southern/western ranges, long transport)

**ACCESS CHALLENGES:**
- **Hilly Terrain:** Pack animals required for 70% of range (cart roads limited)
- **Carcass Size:** 250-400 lbs live = 163-260 lbs dressed (too heavy for one person to carry, quartering standard)
- **Remote Locations:** 4-7 days from major markets (vs whitetail 1-3 days)

**TRANSPORT LOGISTICS:**

**Option 1: Field Quartering + Pack Animals (Most Common):**
- **Process:** Quarter in field (4 quarters + backstraps)
- **Pack Load:** 2-3 mules (each mule carries 60-80 lbs, total 120-240 lbs capacity)
- **Duration:** 2-4 days to nearest market
- **Cost:** 5-15 gp (mule rental + handler, depends on distance)

**Option 2: Chilled Wagon (Group Shipments):**
- **Process:** Multiple hunters pool deer (5-10 deer per wagon)
- **Duration:** 4-7 days to Waterdeep/Baldur's Gate
- **Cost per Deer:** 10-20 gp (divided among group = 5-10 gp per hunter)
- **Advantage:** Fresh meat (not frozen), higher market prices

**Option 3: Local Sale (Immediate, Lower Price):**
- **Markets:** Berdusk, small towns near Trielta Hills
- **Price Penalty:** 20-30% below Waterdeep prices (local demand lower, smaller markets)
- **Advantage:** Zero transport cost, immediate cash

## III. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

### Size and Sexual Dimorphism

**ADULT MALE (Stag):**
- **Live Weight:** 250-400 lbs (avg 325 lbs, **117% heavier than whitetail**)
- **Trophy Size:** 380-450 lbs (5-7 years old, prime condition)
- **Shoulder Height:** 42-52 inches (vs whitetail 36-40 inches, elk 54-60 inches)
- **Body Length:** 75-90 inches
- **Build:** Muscular, thick-necked (especially during rut, neck swells 30-40%)

**ADULT FEMALE (Hind):**
- **Live Weight:** 180-280 lbs (avg 230 lbs, **109% heavier than whitetail doe**)
- **Shoulder Height:** 38-46 inches
- **Body Length:** 70-85 inches
- **Build:** Lighter frame (similar proportions to males, but smaller overall)

**SEXUAL DIMORPHISM:** Red deer show **pronounced size difference** (stags 40-50% heavier than hinds, vs whitetail 30-40%). This dimorphism rivals elk (50-60%) and exceeds mule deer (35-45%).

**SIZE COMPARISON:**
| Metric | Whitetail | Red Deer Stag | Red Deer Hind | Wapiti Elk |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Weight | 150 lbs | 325 lbs | 230 lbs | 750 lbs |
| Height | 38 inches | 47 inches | 42 inches | 57 inches |
| Retail Yield | 52 lbs | 110 lbs | 77 lbs | 255 lbs |

**POSITIONING:** Red deer stags yield **2.1x more meat** than whitetail bucks (110 lbs vs 52 lbs), but **43% less** than wapiti bulls (110 lbs vs 255 lbs). This makes them the **sweet spot for bulk meat** without expedition requirements.

---

### Coat and Coloration

**SUMMER COAT (Kythorn-Eleasis):**
- **Color:** Reddish-brown to russet (namesake "red deer," vivid red-orange tones)
- **Shade Variation:** Lighter on flanks, darker on back (graded coloration)
- **Rump Patch:** Large pale tan to cream patch (10-14 inches diameter, conspicuous)
- **Tail:** Short (6-8 inches), pale tan with dark tip

**WINTER COAT (Uktar-Mirtul):**
- **Color:** Grayish-brown to dark brown (loses summer red tones)
- **Rump Patch:** Cream to white (more prominent in winter)
- **Texture:** Thick, coarse (30-40 mm hair length, insulation for hill/mountain winter)
- **Neck Mane (Stags):** Dark mane develops (shaggy hair 50-80 mm long, rut display feature)

**IDENTIFYING FEATURES:**
- **Large Rump Patch:** Diagnostic (extends above tail, visible from rear at distance)
- **No Spots:** Adults never spotted (unlike fallow deer, even in summer)
- **Dark Legs:** Lower legs darker than body (stockings appearance)
- **Shaggy Neck Mane (Stags):** Winter/rut feature (hinds lack mane)

---

### Antler Characteristics

**STRUCTURE (ELK-LIKE, Not Whitetail-Style):**

Red deer antlers resemble **scaled-down elk antlers** (branching crowns, bez tines) rather than whitetail single-beam style:

**TYPICAL MATURE STAG (5-7 years):**
- **Main Beam:** Long, curved backward (24-36 inches along curve)
- **Brow Tine (G1):** Points forward (8-14 inches, thick)
- **Bez Tine (G2):** Points upward/forward (6-12 inches, diagnostic of red deer/elk, NOT found on whitetail)
- **Trez Tine (G3):** Points upward (4-10 inches)
- **Crown:** Top of antler branches into 2-5 points (crown = multiple terminal points)
- **Total Points:** 10-16 points typical (5-8 per side)

**AGE-BASED DEVELOPMENT:**
- **1.5 years (Yearling):** Spikes OR simple forks (6-10 inches, 2-4 points)
- **2.5 years:** 6-8 points, bez tine develops (brow + bez + 1-2 crown points per side)
- **3.5 years:** 10-12 points, crown forms (brow + bez + trez + 2-3 crown per side)
- **4.5+ years (Mature):** 12-16 points, full crown (brow + bez + trez + 3-5 crown per side)
- **Trophy (6-8 years):** 14-20 points, massive (thick beams, long tines, complex crown)

**ANTLER MEASUREMENTS:**
- **Main Beam Length:** 24-36 inches (vs whitetail 18-24 inches, elk 40-55 inches)
- **Inside Spread:** 20-32 inches (vs whitetail 12-18 inches, elk 36-50 inches)
- **Brow Tine Length:** 8-14 inches (diagnostic measurement, whitetail lack bez)
- **Bez Tine Length:** 6-12 inches (UNIQUE to red deer/elk family)
- **Mass:** Heavy (3-6 lbs per antler vs whitetail 1-2 lbs, elk 8-15 lbs)

---

**GROWTH CYCLE (Same Timing as Whitetail/Elk):**
- **Ches-Tarsakh:** Shedding (mature stags shed early Ches, yearlings late Tarsakh)
- **Tarsakh-Mirtul:** Pedicle healing, velvet budding
- **Mirtul-Flamerule:** Rapid velvet growth (2-4 inches per week)
- **Flamerule-Eleasis:** Peak velvet (alchemical harvest window)
- **Eleasis:** Velvet stripping (stags thrash trees, strips come off in bloody ribbons)
- **Eleint-Alturiak:** Hardened antlers (white to dark gray, stained brown from tree sap/mud)
- **Ches (next year):** Shedding begins anew

---

**ANTLER VALUE:**
- **10-Point (Young Mature):** 40-70 sp (bez tines + crown = decorative appeal)
- **12-Point (Quality Mature):** 70-120 sp (full crown, symmetric)
- **14-16 Point (Trophy):** 120-220 sp (rare, massive, complex crown, estate/noble buyers)
- **Royal Stag (16+ points):** 220-400 sp (exceptional, museum-quality, scored/certified)
- **Velvet Antlers:** 12-30 gp/lb (4-7 lbs per mature stag = 48-210 gp total)

**MARKET PREFERENCE:** Red deer antlers command **50-100% premium** over whitetail due to:
- **Elk-Like Structure:** Crown + bez tines (more complex than whitetail single beam)
- **Size:** 50-100% larger than whitetail (more impressive mounts)
- **Rarity:** Less common than whitetail (scarcity premium)

**PROFESSIONAL TIP:** Red deer antlers are often marketed as **"Hill Elk"** trophies to justify premium pricing (customers perceive them as small elk, not large deer).

---

## IV. SEASONAL BIOLOGY (Harptos Calendar)

### Annual Cycle

**SPRING (Ches-Mirtul):**
- **Ches-Tarsakh:** Antler shedding (stags), late pregnancy (hinds, 230-day gestation)
- **Mirtul:** Calving (1-2 calves, avg 1.3, hinds seek seclusion in dense brush)

**SUMMER (Kythorn-Eleasis):**
- **Kythorn-Flamerule:** Calf rearing (calves nurse 4-6 months), velvet antler growth (stags)
- **Eleasis:** Velvet stripping (stags), calves weaning begins

**FALL (Eleint-Uktar) - HUNTING SEASON & RUT:**
- **Eleint:** Pre-rut fattening (BEST MEAT QUALITY, stags 8-10% body fat, hinds 10-12%)
- **Marpenoth:** RUT SEASON PEAK (stags aggressive, bugling, **DANGEROUS**)
- **Uktar:** Post-rut (stags exhausted, 25-35% body weight loss, POOR meat quality)

**WINTER (Nightal-Alturiak):**
- **Nightal-Alturiak:** Survival mode (stags 4-6% body fat, hinds 6-8%, yarding in sheltered valleys)

---

### Rut Season (Marpenoth) - DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR

**RUT TIMING:** Marpenoth (same as whitetail), but **red deer rut is MORE INTENSE and MORE DANGEROUS** than whitetail:

**STAG BEHAVIOR:**

**Bugling (Vocalization):**
- **Sound:** Deep roaring/bugling (audible 1-2 miles, low-pitched, guttural)
- **Frequency:** Constant during peak rut (5-20 bugles per hour)
- **Purpose:** Attract hinds, intimidate rival stags, establish dominance

**Wallowing:**
- **Behavior:** Stags dig mud wallows (urinate in mud, roll in wallow, coat body)
- **Scent:** Strong musky odor (urine + mud + glandular secretions, permeates meat)
- **Result:** Rut stag meat is **STRONGLY GAMEY** (even worse than whitetail rut bucks)

**Fighting:**
- **Intensity:** Violent clashing (antler-locking, pushing, shoving, full-body contact)
- **Injuries:** 5-10% of mature stags injured per rut (broken antlers, gored flanks, exhaustion)
- **Duration:** Battles last 5-30 minutes (vs whitetail 1-5 minutes)

**Aggression Toward Humans:**
- **Challenge Rating 1/8:** During rut, stags may charge humans (perceive as rivals)
- **Danger:** Antlers can gore (8-14 inch brow tines = serious injury risk)
- **Professional Guidance:** **DO NOT approach rut stags within 50 yards** (vs whitetail 30 yards safe)

**MEAT QUALITY IMPACT:**

**Stags (Rut-Affected):**
- **Flavor:** EXTREMELY GAMEY (testosterone + wallowing + stress = strong urine/musky notes)
- **Texture:** Tough (glycogen depleted, dark muscle, minimal fat)
- **Fat Content:** 2-4% (vs pre-rut 8-10%, 50-75% reduction)
- **Professional Standard:** **"Rut stags = grinding/sausage ONLY"** (add 40-50% pork fat to mask flavor)

**Hinds (Rut-Affected):**
- **Flavor:** Moderate stress (chased by stags, herd disruption)
- **Texture:** Good (still feeding actively)
- **Fat Content:** 8-10% (maintained through rut)
- **Professional Standard:** Acceptable (but Eleint pre-rut hinds superior)

---

### Optimal Harvest Timing

**BEST:** Eleint (Early Fall, Pre-Rut)
- Stags: 8-10% body fat, mild flavor, tender
- Hinds: 10-12% body fat, excellent quality
- Weather: Cool (50-65°F), easy field preservation
- **Recommendation:** PRIMARY HARVEST WINDOW

**GOOD:** Late Eleasis (Late Summer)
- Stags: 7-9% body fat, just post-velvet
- Hinds: 9-11% body fat
- Weather: Warm (65-75°F), faster spoilage risk
- **Recommendation:** Acceptable if Eleint not available

**POOR:** Marpenoth (Rut Season)
- Stags: AVOID (gamey, lean, aggressive/dangerous)
- Hinds: Acceptable (but Eleint better)
- **Recommendation:** Hind harvest only

**VERY POOR:** Uktar-Alturiak (Post-Rut, Winter)
- Stags: 2-4% body fat (emaciated)
- Hinds: 6-8% body fat (declining)
- **Recommendation:** AVOID except population control culls

---

## V. FIELD HARVESTING

### Hunting Considerations

**TERRAIN:**
- **Hilly/Mountainous:** 30-60% slopes common (Trielta Hills = rolling hills 1,000-3,000 ft)
- **Vegetation:** Mixed forest/meadow (open areas for spotting, forest for stalking)
- **Visibility:** Better than whitetail habitat (red deer prefer more open terrain)

**HUNTING DIFFICULTY:**
- **Wariness:** High (similar to mule deer, more cautious than whitetail)
- **Vocal:** Rut season bugling reveals location (advantage for hunters)
- **Herds:** 5-20 individuals (larger groups than whitetail, easier to locate but more eyes watching)

**SHOT PLACEMENT:**
- **Vital Zone:** 12-16 inches diameter (larger than whitetail 10-12 inches, smaller than elk 16-20 inches)
- **Arrow Penetration Required:** 12-18 inches (deep chest, thick-bodied animal)
- **Broadside Preferred:** Quartering shots risky (heavy shoulder bones can deflect arrows)

---

### Field Dressing (Large Carcass Challenges)

**TIME REQUIRED:**
- **Experienced:** 30-45 minutes (325 lb red deer, significantly longer than whitetail 15-25 minutes)
- **Novice:** 50-80 minutes

**PROCEDURE (Same Steps as Whitetail, Larger Scale):**
1. **Position:** Deer on back (HEAVY, may require 2 people to roll/position)
2. **Initial Cut:** Sternum to pelvis (12-18 inch cut vs whitetail 8-12 inches)
3. **Open Cavity:** Cut abdominal muscle (thicker than whitetail, more force required)
4. **Remove Organs:** Pull heart/lungs/intestines (40-60 lbs total vs whitetail 25-35 lbs, HEAVY)
5. **Save Edibles:** Heart (1-1.5 lbs), Liver (3-5 lbs)

**FIELD DRESSED WEIGHT:**
- **Live Weight:** 325 lbs
- **Dressing %:** 65% (same as whitetail)
- **Field Dressed:** 325 × 65% = **211 lbs** (vs whitetail 117 lbs, **81% heavier**)

---

### Quartering (REQUIRED for Most Hunts)

**WHY QUARTERING IS STANDARD:**
- **Weight:** 211 lbs field-dressed (too heavy for one person to drag/carry)
- **Terrain:** Hilly terrain (dragging uphill impossible)
- **Pack Animals:** Mules carry 60-80 lbs each (whole carcass exceeds capacity)

**QUARTERING PROCEDURE:**

**1. REMOVE FRONT LEGS (SHOULDERS):**
- Cut shoulder from rib cage (muscle only, no bone sawing)
- **Weight:** 35-45 lbs each (vs whitetail 20-25 lbs, 75% heavier)

**2. REMOVE HIND LEGS (HAMS):**
- Cut through hip joint OR disarticulate
- **Weight:** 50-65 lbs each (vs whitetail 28-35 lbs, 79% heavier)

**3. REMOVE BACKSTRAPS:**
- Cut along spine, peel from ribs
- **Weight:** 5-7 lbs each (10-14 lbs total, vs whitetail 4-6 lbs total)

**4. REMOVE TENDERLOINS (Optional, Field Conditions):**
- Reach inside body cavity, cut from spine
- **Weight:** 1-1.5 lbs each (2-3 lbs total)

**5. RIBS/NECK (Usually LEFT in Field):**
- **Reason:** Pack capacity limited (prioritize highest-value cuts)
- **Ribs:** 12-16 lbs (if space allows, take for smoking/braising)
- **Neck:** 10-14 lbs (grinding meat, low priority)
- **Alternative:** Return next day with additional pack animals (if close to access point)

**QUARTER WEIGHTS (325 lb Red Deer):**
- Front Quarters (2): 35-45 lbs each = 70-90 lbs total
- Hind Quarters (2): 50-65 lbs each = 100-130 lbs total
- Backstraps: 10-14 lbs
- Tenderloins: 2-3 lbs
- **PACKED TOTAL:** 182-237 lbs

**PACK ANIMAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **3 Mules (Standard):** Each carries 60-80 lbs (total capacity 180-240 lbs)
- **2 Mules + 1 Hunter:** Mules carry 120-160 lbs, hunter carries 20-30 lbs (backstraps/tenderloins)

---

## VI. BUTCHER SHOP PROCESSING

### Yield Calculation (325 lb Red Deer Stag)

**STEP 1: Live to Dressed (65%)**
- Live Weight: 325 lbs
- Dressing %: 65% (same as whitetail/elk, universal cervine formula)
- Dressed Weight: 325 × 65% = **211 lbs**

**STEP 2: Dressed to Retail (45%)**
- Dressed Weight: 211 lbs
- Retail %: 45% of dressed (same as whitetail)
- Retail Weight: 211 × 45% = **95 lbs**

**FINAL TOTAL YIELD:** 29% (325 lbs live → 95 lbs retail)

**COMPARISON TO OTHER CERVINES:**
| Cervine | Live Weight | Dressed (65%) | Retail (45%) | Retail % of Live |
|---------|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| Whitetail | 150 lbs | 98 lbs | 44 lbs | 29% |
| Mule Deer | 200 lbs | 130 lbs | 59 lbs | 29% |
| **Red Deer** | **325 lbs** | **211 lbs** | **95 lbs** | **29%** |
| Wapiti Elk | 750 lbs | 488 lbs | 220 lbs | 29% |

**FORMULA CONSISTENCY:** All cervines (deer, elk, moose) yield **29% live-to-retail** (65% dressing × 45% retail = 29%). Red deer are simply **scaled-up whitetails** in terms of processing.

---

### Primary Breakdown

**THE 7 PRIMALS (211 lb Dressed Red Deer):**
| Primal | Weight | % of Dressed |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Shoulders (2) | 64-75 lbs | 30-36% |
| Hams (2) | 95-120 lbs | 45-57% |
| Backstraps (2) | 10-14 lbs | 5-7% |

| Ribs | 15-20 lbs | 7-9% |
| Neck | 12-16 lbs | 6-8% |
| Shanks (4) | 15-20 lbs | 7-9% |

**PROCESSING CHALLENGES:**

**Large Cuts = Heavy Lifting:**
- **Hind Quarters:** 50-65 lbs each (requires 2 butchers to maneuver safely)
- **Shoulders:** 35-45 lbs each (manageable for 1 butcher, but cumbersome)

**Saw Work Increases:**
- **Bone Thickness:** Red deer bones thicker than whitetail (requires heavy-duty saw)
- **Rib Splitting:** Sawing ribs from spine takes 3-5 minutes (vs whitetail 1-2 minutes)

**PROCESSING TIME:**
- **Journeyman Butcher:** 9-12 hours (vs whitetail 6-8 hours, +50% time due to size/weight)
- **Master Butcher:** 7-9 hours
- **Apprentice:** 12-16 hours

**LABOR COST:**
- **Time:** 9-12 hours
- **Rate:** 4 sp/hour (standard guild rate)
- **Cost:** 36-48 sp = **3.6-4.8 gp** (vs whitetail 2.4-3.2 gp)

---

### Secondary Breakdown (Butcher's Choice)

**SAME OPTIONS AS WHITETAIL** (see § 02_SWORD_COAST_WHITETAIL: Secondary Breakdown), but **larger portions**:

**SHOULDERS (64-75 lbs total):**
- **Roasts:** 3-4 roasts, 18-25 lbs each (LARGE, serve 10-15 people per roast)
- **Grinding:** 32-40 lbs ground venison (high volume)
- **Mixed:** Top blade roast (15-20 lbs) + grind the rest (20-30 lbs)

**HAMS (95-120 lbs total):**
- **Steaks:** 30-45 steaks, 2-3 lbs each (LARGE steaks, serve 2-3 people each)
- **Roasts:** 6-8 roasts, 12-18 lbs each (feast-sized)
- **Bone-In vs Boneless:** Customer choice (bone-in = traditional presentation, boneless = easier carving)

**BACKSTRAPS (10-14 lbs total):**
- **Whole:** 2 straps, 5-7 lbs each (impressive presentation, slice tableside)
- **Steaks:** 15-20 steaks, 8-12 oz each (individual portions)

**TENDERLOINS (2-3 lbs total):**
- **Whole:** 2 tenderloins, 1-1.5 lbs each (premium cuts)

**RIBS (15-20 lbs):**
- **Rack:** Leave whole (French-style presentation, roast whole for 15-20 people)
- **Individual Ribs:** 12-14 ribs (large, 1-1.5 lbs each)

---

### Aging (CRITICAL for Red Deer)

**RED DEER REQUIRE LONGER AGING THAN WHITETAIL:**

**Reasons:**
- **Larger Muscle Mass:** Bigger muscles = more connective tissue = longer breakdown time
- **Active Lifestyle:** Hill/mountain terrain = denser muscle fibers (vs whitetail lowland forests)
- **Age of Harvest:** Mature stags (5-7 years) tougher than young whitetails (2-4 years)

**AGING SCHEDULE:**
- **Minimum:** 12-14 days (vs whitetail 7-10 days)
- **Standard:** 14-18 days (vs whitetail 10-12 days)
- **Extended:** 18-21 days (vs whitetail 14-16 days, trophy stags only)
- **Temperature:** 34-38°F
- **Humidity:** 70-75%

**PROFESSIONAL TIP:** **DO NOT rush aging on red deer.** Cutting at 10 days yields tough, chewy meat (customers complain, returns, damage to reputation). Better to age 16-18 days and deliver tender product.

| Mule Deer | 200 lbs | 54 gp | 48-50 gp | 2.7 gp/lb |
| **Red Deer** | **325 lbs** | **80-85 gp** | **72-79 gp** | **2.5 gp/lb** |
| Wapiti Elk | 750 lbs | 220-240 gp | 195-215 gp | 3.2 gp/lb |

**KEY INSIGHT:** Red deer offer **2.1x the total value of whitetail** (72-79 gp vs 35-38 gp) while maintaining **similar per-pound value** (2.5 gp/lb). This makes them attractive for bulk purchases.

### Economics of Bulk Processing

**EXAMPLE: Family Purchases Entire Red Deer**

**Scenario:** Family of 6, buying meat for 3 months (Uktar-Alturiak winter supply)

**Option 1: Buy 2 Whitetails (Traditional Approach)**
- **Cost:** 2 deer @ 35-38 gp each = **70-76 gp**
- **Yield:** 2 × 52 lbs = **104 lbs retail**
- **Processing:** 2 separate pickups, 2 storage sessions

**Option 2: Buy 1 Red Deer (Bulk Approach)**
- **Cost:** 1 deer @ **72-79 gp**
- **Yield:** **95 lbs retail** (9% less meat than 2 whitetails)
- **Processing:** 1 pickup, 1 storage session
- **Convenience:** Easier (one transaction)
- **Savings:** No savings on cost, but **equal value for less hassle**

**PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION:** Red deer attractive to:
- **Large Families:** One deer = substantial supply (vs buying 3-4 whitetails over time)
- **Group Purchases:** 2-3 families split one red deer (each gets 30-45 lbs, share processing cost)
- **Feast Buyers:** Temples, noble houses (one red deer serves 20-25 people, vs 2-3 whitetails)

## VIII. CULINARY APPLICATIONS

### Meat Quality

**TASTE:**
- **Richer than Whitetail:** More pronounced "wild" flavor (not as mild as fallow, not as strong as elk)
- **Comparison:** Red deer flavor = "150% of whitetail intensity" (beefy, gamey, but not overwhelming)
- **Rut Influence:** EXTREME if stag harvested during rut (wallowing + urine = very strong, avoid)

**TEXTURE:**
- **Coarser Grain:** Larger muscle fibers than whitetail (noticeable texture difference)
- **Requires Aging:** 14-18 days mandatory (under-aged = tough, chewy)
- **Post-Aging:** Comparable tenderness to whitetail (if properly aged)

**FAT CONTENT:**
- **Pre-Rut (Eleint):** 8-10% body fat (same as whitetail)
- **Post-Rut (Uktar):** 2-4% body fat (stags emaciated, avoid)

---

### Cooking Techniques

**ALL WHITETAIL TECHNIQUES APPLY** (see § 02_SWORD_COAST_WHITETAIL: Culinary Applications), but **adjust portion sizes**:

**BACKSTRAP STEAKS:**
- **Size:** 8-12 oz steaks (vs whitetail 4-6 oz, DOUBLE portion)
- **Cooking:** Same method (pan sear, reverse sear, grill), +2-3 minutes per side due to thickness
- **Serving:** 1 red deer steak = 1 serving (vs 2 whitetail steaks)

**ROASTS:**
- **Size:** 18-25 lb shoulder roasts (vs whitetail 8-12 lbs, DOUBLE)
- **Cooking:** Same method (braise, slow roast), +50% time (4-6 hours vs whitetail 3-4 hours)
- **Serving:** 1 red deer roast serves 10-15 people (vs whitetail 5-8 people)

### Recipe: Feast Roast - Red Deer Haunch

**TRADITIONAL NOBLE FEAST DISH:**

**INGREDIENTS:**
- Red deer hind quarter (bone-in), 50-65 lbs (entire haunch)
- Garlic (2 heads, cloves inserted into meat)
- Rosemary (10 sprigs, fresh)
- Red wine (2 bottles, marinade + basting)
- Onions (5 large, quartered)
- Carrots (8, rough chop)
- Butter (1 lb, basting)
- Salt, black pepper

**METHOD:**
1. **Marinate:** Rub haunch with garlic/rosemary/salt/pepper, pour wine over, refrigerate 24-48 hours
2. **Roast Setup:** Place haunch in large roasting pan, surround with vegetables
3. **Initial Roast:** 450°F oven, 30 minutes (sear exterior)
4. **Slow Roast:** Reduce to 275°F, 6-8 hours (to 180°F internal, fall-apart tender)
5. **Baste:** Every 30 minutes (wine + butter + pan drippings)
6. **Rest:** 30 minutes (tent with foil)
7. **Carve:** Slice against grain, 1/4-inch slices, serve with pan gravy

**SERVING:** Serves 20-30 people (2-3 oz cooked meat per person, with sides)

**OCCASION:** Noble weddings, festival feasts (Midsummer, Shieldmeet), military banquets, temple celebrations

**COST:**
- Red deer haunch (1/2 deer): 35-45 gp (meat alone)
- Ingredients: 10-15 gp (wine, vegetables, butter, herbs)
- Labor (chef): 10-15 gp (8-10 hours prep + cooking)
- **TOTAL:** 55-75 gp

**PRESTIGE VALUE:** Serving whole red deer haunch = status display (shows wealth, generosity, connection to huntsmen/provisioners).

| **Aging Required** | 10-12 days | 14-18 days | 18-21 days |
| **Market** | Universal | Bulk buyers, feasts | Luxury, expeditions |

**RED DEER NICHE:**
- **"Accessible Bulk Venison":** 2.1x whitetail yield (95 lbs vs 52 lbs) without expedition costs
- **Bridge Species:** Larger than common deer, smaller than elk (fills gap in market)
- **Feast-Sized Cuts:** Single roast serves 10-15 people (vs whitetail 5-8, elk 20-30)
- **Family Bulk Purchases:** One deer = 2-3 months supply (vs 4-6 whitetails)
- **Moderate Danger:** CR 1/8 during rut (caution required, but not as dangerous as moose CR 1/2)

**WHEN TO CHOOSE RED DEER:**
- **Bulk Meat Needs:** Family/group purchasing for extended period (2-3 months)
- **Feast Preparation:** Temples, noble houses, military (serving 15-30 people)
- **One-Stop Shopping:** Prefer single large deer over multiple small deer
- **Trophy + Meat:** Antlers decorative (elk-like bez tines, crown) + substantial meat yield

**WHEN TO CHOOSE WHITETAIL:**
- **Smaller Household:** 2-4 people (red deer too much meat, risk waste)
- **Storage Limitations:** Limited freezer space (red deer 95 lbs = significant volume)
- **Easy Access:** Prefer 1-3 day local hunts (vs red deer 2-4 days + harder terrain)
- **Milder Flavor:** Red deer gamier than whitetail (some customers prefer mild)
