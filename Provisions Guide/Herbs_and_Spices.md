# HERBS & SPICES
## The Master Provisioner's Guide to Seasonings, Salts, Peppers, and Aromatics

*Seasonings are the difference between bland survival rations and actual food. Good spices are expensive but essential - they make cheap ingredients taste good and preserve morale on long journeys. A provisioner who only stocks one type of salt or pepper is marking themselves as amateur.*

## CRITICAL PROFESSIONAL NOTE

**Professional cooks don't just say "get salt" - they specify fine sea salt for general cooking, smoked salt for finishing, or black volcanic salt for exotic dishes. Same with pepper: whole black peppercorns are standard, but white pepper won't show specks in white sauces, and green peppercorns bring completely different flavors to steaks.**

**This isn't luxury - it's basic professional knowledge.**

## About This Category

Herbs and spices range from cheap rock salt to saffron worth more than gold. Understanding varieties, processing states, and proper storage is essential for professional provisioning.

**Fresh vs. Dried:**
- Fresh herbs are milder and used in larger quantities
- Dried herbs/spices are concentrated - use about 1/3 the amount of dried compared to fresh
- Some herbs (thyme, rosemary, oregano) dry excellently
- Others (basil, cilantro, parsley) lose quality when dried

**Storage:**
- Keep all spices and dried herbs in sealed containers
- Away from light, heat, and moisture
- Whole spices last much longer than ground
- They lose potency over time - buy in quantities you'll use

**Common uses:**
- Seasoning and flavor enhancement
- Preservation (salt)
- Medicinal preparations
- Spice blends and rubs
- Magical effects (rare varieties)

## HELENA'S FINAL THOUGHTS ON HERBS & SPICES

*Professional cooks don't just say "get salt" - they specify fine sea salt for general cooking, smoked salt for finishing, or black volcanic salt for exotic dishes. Same with pepper: whole black peppercorns are standard, but white pepper won't show specks in white sauces, and green peppercorns bring completely different flavors to steaks.*

*This isn't luxury - it's basic professional knowledge. A provisioner who only stocks one type of each is marking themselves as amateur.*

*Fresh herbs are for when you need that bright, vibrant flavor. Dried herbs are for when you need concentrated, dependable flavor year-round. Both have their place. Anyone telling you fresh is always better doesn't understand cooking - dried thyme is often better than fresh in long-cooked dishes.*

*Saffron costs fifty gold pieces an ounce because it takes 75,000 flowers picked by hand to make a pound. If someone offers you "cheap saffron," it's fake. Buy from trusted sources or don't buy at all.*

*The magical varieties with game mechanics exist, but they're rare and expensive. Don't pay rare-item prices for common spices with a *Light* cantrip. Test everything.*
