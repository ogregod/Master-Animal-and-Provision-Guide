# ROOTS & TUBERS
## Underground Vegetables, Bulbs, and Storage Crops

Roots and tubers are your foundation ingredients. They store well, travel well, and feed people cheaply. Every provisioner should know these inside and out.

**Key principles for root vegetable buying:**
- Heavy for size means fresh and full of moisture
- Check for soft spots (indicates rot)
- Green potatoes are toxic (cut away all green parts)
- Storage roots should be dirty (don't wash until ready to use)
- Sprouting means old (flavor and nutrition decline)
