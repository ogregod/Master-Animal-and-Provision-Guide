## Introduction

I've been provisioning expeditions, armies, noble houses, and adventuring companies for thirty-two years. In that time, I've sourced everything from common turnips to Feywild Moonradishes, supplied siege preparations and wedding feasts, and learned more about ingredients than any sane person should know.

This guide is the result of those three decades. Every ingredient listed here, I've personally handled, purchased, stored, or (in most cases) cooked with. The weights, uses, and costs are real numbers from real markets. The descriptions are what you'll actually see when you buy them.

**What this guide covers:**
- 325+ ingredients across six categories
- Exact weights and portion yields
- Market prices (Waterdeep standard, adjust for your region)
- Storage requirements and shelf life
- Identification tips (what to look for when buying)
- Warnings about dangerous or magical items
- Practical usage notes

**What this guide doesn't cover:**
- Recipes (that's a different book)
- Alchemy (I'm a provisioner, not a wizard)
- Farming techniques (I buy ingredients, I don't grow them)

If you're feeding people - whether it's a tavern full of customers, an army on the march, or a party of adventurers heading into the Underdark - this guide will tell you what to buy, how much to pay, and how to keep it from spoiling.

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is organized by ingredient category, matching standard market classifications:

1. **Roots & Tubers** - Underground vegetables, bulbs, and storage crops
2. **Leafy Greens** - Fresh vegetables, cabbages, and salad materials
3. **Mushrooms** - Fungi of all types, from common to magical
4. **Fruits** - Tree fruits, berries, and tropical imports
5. **Herbs & Spices** - Seasonings, both fresh and dried
6. **Beverages** - Ales, wines, and spirits in various quantities

### Understanding the Information

For each ingredient, you'll find:

**Name** - Common market name  
**Rarity** - How hard it is to find:
- Common: Any general store or market
- Uncommon: Specialty shops, larger towns
- Rare: Import merchants, wizards, alchemists
- Very Rare: Exclusive dealers, dangerous to obtain
- Legendary: Priceless, theoretical, or non-purchasable

**Price** - Standard Waterdeep market rate (adjust ±30% for region)  
**Weight** - Total weight of the item as sold  
**Uses** - Total portions/servings from the full weight  
**Type** - Food (safe to eat), Drink (beverage), or Poison (dangerous/requires preparation)  
**Description** - What you're actually buying  
**Unidentified** - What it looks like if you don't know what it is

### Understanding "Uses"

A "use" represents one practical application:
- **For vegetables:** One serving for one person (4-6 oz cooked weight typically)
- **For spices/herbs:** One tablespoon or one recipe portion
- **For salt:** One teaspoon
- **For beverages:** One serving (mug, cup, or shot as appropriate)

**Example:** Sea Salt (1 lb, 96 uses) means you get 96 teaspoons from 1 pound.

**Example:** Silverymoon Carrots (1 lb, 4 uses) means you can make 4 servings from 1 pound.

### Conversion Notes

For practical kitchen work:
- **1 tablespoon** = 3 teaspoons = 0.5 oz (for most spices)
- **1 cup** = 16 tablespoons = 8 oz
- **1 pound** = 16 oz
- **Typical serving size** = 4-6 oz cooked vegetables, 2-3 oz meat, 1-2 oz grains

### Price Variations by Region

The prices listed are Waterdeep standard (1492 DR). Adjust for your location:

**Major Cities** (Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter): Listed price  
**Trade Towns** (Daggerford, Triboar, Beregost): +10-20%  
**Frontier Settlements** (Phandalin, Longsaddle): +30-50%  
**Remote Villages**: +50-100% (or unavailable)  
**Rural Farming Areas**: -20-30% for local produce

**Seasonal Variations:**
- Spring: Fresh greens cheaper, winter storage more expensive
- Summer: Fruits and vegetables abundant, -20% on seasonal items
- Fall: Harvest time, bulk goods cheaper
- Winter: Fresh produce scarce, +30-50% on most items

### A Note on Magical Ingredients

Items marked as **Rare, Very Rare, or Legendary** often have magical properties. These are:
- Expensive and hard to find
- May require special handling or storage
- Could be illegal in some jurisdictions
- Often sought by wizards, alchemists, or collectors
- Potentially dangerous if misused

I've included warnings where appropriate. Use common sense.

## FINAL NOTES FROM HELENA

Well met, provisioner! You've made it through all six categories of The Master Provisioner's Guide. Remember these key principles:

**Quality over quantity:** One good apple will sustain better than three poor ones.

**Know your sources:** Trust your suppliers. Bad ingredients make bad food, and bad food kills customers.

**Proper storage:** Half of provisioning is keeping things fresh. The other half is knowing when to throw things out.

**Regional variation:** Prices change by region. A pineapple costs 10 gold pieces in Waterdeep, might be 2 silver in Maztica, and unobtainable in Icewind Dale.

**Magical items:** If it glows, phases, or whispers, verify it with magic detection before selling. Your reputation depends on authenticity.

**Safety first:** When in doubt about wild mushrooms, strange herbs, or magical foods - DON'T EAT IT. Consult an expert.

**Customer education:** Your job isn't just to sell. It's to teach people how to store, prepare, and use ingredients properly. A living customer is a repeat customer.

May your scales be honest, your storage be cool, and your customers be satisfied.
