# CLOSING NOTES
## Final Thoughts from Helena Fairstock

---

Well met, provisioner. If you've read this far, you're either very thorough or very bored. Either way, here are some final thoughts after thirty-two years in this business.

---

## WHAT I'VE LEARNED

### The Work Never Stops

Provisioning isn't a job you do from dawn to dusk and then forget. It's knowing that the mushroom season is two weeks late, that the Trielta Hills garlic harvest was poor, that a ship from Calimshan is three days overdue with your citrus order.

You track seasons, weather, trade routes, and market gossip. You maintain relationships with farmers, foragers, importers, and fellow provisioners. You inspect goods, calculate costs, manage storage, and plan for shortages.

It's unglamorous work. No one writes songs about the quartermaster who kept an army fed through winter. No one tells legends about the tavern keeper who never ran out of ale. But these people keep civilization running.

### Honesty Is Not Optional

I've seen merchants who sold moldy grain, passed off death caps as edible mushrooms, or claimed common ale was magical elven wine. Some got rich quickly. None lasted five years.

Your reputation is everything. One case of food poisoning traced to your stock can end you. One customer who discovers you sold fake magical items will tell everyone. Word spreads fast in merchant communities.

Honest scales, honest prices, honest warnings about quality issues. This isn't idealism - it's survival.

### Know When to Say No

Not every deal is worth taking.

If someone offers you suspiciously cheap "Evermeet mead" that doesn't detect as magical, walk away. If a forager brings you mushrooms they "think" are safe, refuse them. If an adventurer wants you to provision an expedition to somewhere obviously suicidal, you can decline.

You're not obligated to sell to everyone or source everything requested. Sometimes "I can't help you" is the right answer.

### The Math Always Matters

Provisioning is arithmetic. Weight, volume, servings, storage times, spoilage rates, bulk discounts, seasonal price swings, transport costs.

You can't eyeball it and hope for the best. You need to calculate real costs including waste. You need to know that fresh milk at 5 copper per gallon with 50% spoilage is more expensive than preserved cheese at 3 silver per pound with no spoilage.

Keep records. Track actual usage versus purchased amounts. Learn your real spoilage rates. Adjust your calculations based on facts, not hopes.

### Feed People Well

This is the fundamental principle that matters more than anything else.

Whether you're feeding a noble house banquet or provisioning field rations for soldiers, the quality of food affects everything. Good food keeps morale high, health good, and work efficient. Bad food - even if it's cheap - costs more in the long run when people get sick, weak, or dead.

You have a responsibility. People trust you to provide safe, nutritious, properly stored provisions. Take that seriously.

## COMMON MISTAKES (I've Made Most of These)

**1. Buying Too Much Fresh Produce**
Fresh berries spoil in 2-3 days. Fresh milk spoils in 1-2 days. Buy what you'll use immediately, not what seems like a good deal. I learned this the expensive way.

**2. Trusting "Cheap Deals" on Expensive Items**
Saffron at half price? Either it's fake or stolen. Magical items at bargain prices? Fake. Specialty imports below market rates? Something's wrong with them. There are no secret deals - just scams.

**3. Ignoring Seasonal Planning**
Root vegetables are cheap in fall, expensive in spring. Buy and store accordingly. Don't pay premium prices in spring for what you could have bought cheap in fall.

**4. Poor Storage Organization**
"First in, first out" is not optional. Rotate stock. The oldest items get used first. Otherwise you're finding moldy grain in the back of the storage room while buying fresh grain for the front.

**5. Not Building Supplier Relationships**
The suppliers who know you, trust you, and value your repeat business will warn you about problems, save good products for you, and help during shortages. Transactional relationships don't provide that.

**6. Skimping on Storage Infrastructure**
Proper storage saves more money than it costs. Cool cellars for roots, dry storage for grains, sealed containers for everything. Every copper you save by using cheaper storage, you lose tenfold to spoilage.

**7. Not Verifying Magical Items**
*Detect Magic* is not optional for magical provisions. Fakes are everywhere. Your reputation depends on selling authentic products. Spend the 5 silver to hire a caster to verify that 50 gold purchase.

**8. Ignoring Safety**
Wild mushroom foraging, water quality testing, allergen warnings - these aren't suggestions. They're requirements. Poisoning people ends your business and possibly your freedom.

## ADVICE FOR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS

### For New Provisioners

Start small. Learn storage before you buy in bulk. Build relationships before you negotiate prices. Ask questions - experienced provisioners would rather explain than watch you fail.

Don't try to stock everything immediately. Start with staples, learn them thoroughly, then expand. Mastering twenty items is better than poorly handling two hundred.

Find a mentor if possible. I learned more from experienced provisioners in my first year than from any book.

### For Tavern Keepers

Your ale quality matters more than anything else on your menu. A tavern with bad ale will fail even if the food is excellent. Get this right first.

Calculate per-serving costs religiously. That 1 silver chicken needs to provide 6-8 servings to be profitable after cooking loss, sides, and overhead.

Seasonal menus aren't luxury - they're economics. Feature what's cheap and abundant, minimize what's expensive and scarce.

### For Army Quartermasters

Nutrition basics matter for armies: grain for energy, preserved meat/fish for protein, root vegetables for bulk, salt for preservation, and citrus/sauerkraut to prevent scurvy on long campaigns.

Calculate per-soldier-per-day: approximately 1.5 lbs grain, 0.5 lbs protein, 1 lb vegetables, 0.5 gallons water. Adjust for activity level and climate.

Preserved foods cost more but don't require refrigeration and don't spoil. For field operations, this is worth the price.

### For Adventuring Parties

Weight matters when you're carrying everything. Prioritize dried fruits, hardtack, preserved meats, dense cheeses - maximum nutrition per pound.

Don't bring fresh greens or fresh milk on dungeon expeditions. They'll spoil in your pack within days.

Water purification is critical. Either carry *Purify Food and Drink* scrolls or boil everything.

### For Ship Provisioners

Scurvy prevention is mandatory on long voyages: citrus fruits, sauerkraut, pickled vegetables. It's not optional.

Calculate water needs generously: 1 gallon per person per day minimum, more in hot climates.

Hard biscuits/hardtack, salted meat, dried fish, cheese aged in wax - these are ship staples because they don't spoil in humid conditions.

## ON MAGICAL PROVISIONS

The market for magical food and beverages is lucrative but dangerous.

**Real magical items exist** and command premium prices for legitimate reasons. Elverquisst removes exhaustion. Phoenix Tears provide powerful healing. Magical grains offer supernatural benefits.

**Fakes outnumber real items 100 to 1** in many markets. Colored water sold as potions. Regular mead labeled as Evermead. Common mushrooms claimed to be magical varieties.

**Your responsibility** as a provisioner is to sell authentic products or clearly label items as "claimed magical properties, unverified."

Never represent something as magical unless you've verified it with *Detect Magic* or equivalent. Never buy "magical" items from questionable sources. Never pass along obvious fakes.

This isn't just ethics - it's self-preservation. Selling fake magical items can get you:
- Banned from merchant guilds
- Fined heavily by city authorities
- Sued by angry customers (including angry adventurers with swords)
- Imprisoned for fraud in some jurisdictions

Not worth it. Stick to authentic products.

## ON PRICES AND NEGOTIATION

The prices in this guide are baselines, not absolutes.

Good provisioners negotiate. You should expect to:
- Get 10-20% discounts on bulk purchases
- Pay 20-50% premiums for small quantities
- Pay 50-200% premiums for out-of-season items
- Pay 100-300% premiums for items during shortages
- Get loyalty discounts from regular suppliers
- Pay extra for rush orders or special requests

**Negotiation isn't about being cheap** - it's about getting fair value. Know the baseline prices, understand the factors affecting cost, and negotiate honestly.

Don't insult suppliers with lowball offers. Don't accept obviously inflated prices without pushing back. Build relationships where both parties benefit.

---

## REGIONAL NOTES WORTH REMEMBERING

**Goldenfields** produces most grain for the Sword Coast. Wheat, barley, oats - if it's grain, it probably came from there. Prices are lowest at the source.

**Trielta Hills** is garlic and onion country. The soil is perfect for alliums. Regional specialties command premium prices elsewhere.

**Waterdeep** is the import hub. Exotic fruits, rare spices, foreign wines - they come through Waterdeep's port. Prices are high but selection is unmatched.

**Daggerford** grows vegetables and brewing grains. Reliable source for basics, not spectacular but consistent.

**Icewind Dale** has almost no local produce. Everything is imported at premium prices or hunted/foraged locally.

**Calimshan** exports citrus, dates, spices, rice, and anything else that grows in hot climates. Long trade routes mean high prices in the north.

**Underdark** produces mushrooms and unusual crops. Expensive to source, requiring connections with drow or deep dwarf traders.

Know your trade routes and regional specialties. It matters.

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Provisioning is honest work.

You're not saving the world from demon lords. You're not discovering ancient ruins. You're not casting world-changing magic.

You're keeping people fed. You're preventing starvation and disease. You're ensuring armies can march, ships can sail, taverns can serve customers, and adventurers can focus on whatever mad quest they've chosen.

This matters. Someone has to do it. Do it well.

Buy honest. Store properly. Calculate carefully. Build relationships. Feed people well.

Everything else follows.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR THIS EDITION

Thanks to everyone who pointed out I'd published five editions without a grains section. You were absolutely right and I'm embarrassed it took this long.

Thanks to the readers who submitted corrections for previous editions - especially the mushroom forager who caught three dangerous identification errors.

Thanks to the Waterdeep Merchant's Guild for maintaining standards worth maintaining.

Thanks to suppliers throughout the Sword Coast who've taught me more than any book could.

And thanks to everyone who takes provisioning seriously. The world needs more people who understand that feeding others well is work worth doing right.
