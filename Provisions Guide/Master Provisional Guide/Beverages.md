## The Master Provisioner's Guide to Waters, Ales, Wines, Spirits, and Magical Draughts

*After 32 years in the provisioning business, I've seen more people killed by bad water than bad food. Take beverages seriously. - Helena Fairstock*

---

## CRITICAL PROFESSIONAL NOTES

**Water Safety:** More people die from contaminated water than poisoned food. ALWAYS verify water sources. When in doubt, boil it, add wine to it, or use magical purification. A tavern that serves clean water will thrive. One that doesn't will have a reputation for sickness.

**Alcohol Economics:** In many regions, ale is safer and cheaper than clean water. This isn't luxury - it's basic public health. The fermentation process kills most waterborne diseases. Small ale (2-3% alcohol) is the working person's daily beverage, not because they're alcoholics, but because it won't give them dysentery.

**Storage Reality:** Fresh milk spoils in 1-2 days. Wine lasts years. Coffee loses flavor in hours. Spirits last indefinitely. Know your storage times or you'll lose money on spoilage.

**Quality Matters:** Cheap gin creates alcoholics and ruins reputations. Good gin is a respectable spirit. The difference is in the distillation quality, not the recipe. Same applies to every spirit - quality varies dramatically within each type.

**Magical Beverages:** If someone offers you Elverquisst at 5 gold pieces a bottle instead of 50, it's fake. Magical beverages command premium prices for good reason. Verify with *Detect Magic* before purchasing. Your reputation depends on selling authentic products.

## WATER & NON-ALCOHOLIC BASICS

### Fresh Water
**Rarity:** Common | **Price:** Free to 1 cp per gallon | **Weight:** 8 lbs per gallon | **Uses:** Variable | **Type:** Drink

**What you're buying:** Clean drinking water from wells, springs, or cisterns.

**Quality grades:**
- **Spring water (best):** Clear, cold, naturally filtered through rock
- **Well water (good):** Generally clean, taste varies by location and depth
- **River water (risky):** Must be boiled - contains parasites and disease
- **Rainwater (acceptable):** Clean if collected properly in clean containers
- **City water (varies):** Quality depends entirely on municipal infrastructure

**Storage:**
- Sealed containers for transport (prevents contamination)
- Clay or ceramic vessels keep water coolest
- Leather or wooden containers for field use
- Shelf life: 1 week without treatment, indefinite if properly sealed

**CRITICAL SAFETY NOTES:**
- **NEVER drink untreated water from unknown sources**
- Boil for 10 minutes minimum to purify questionable water
- Add wine, ale, or vinegar for preservation on long journeys
- Dehydration kills faster than hunger - water is not optional

**Purification methods:**
1. **Boiling:** Most reliable - kills all common pathogens
2. **Wine addition:** 1 part wine to 3 parts water (traditional field method)
3. **Vinegar:** Splash per gallon helps preservation
4. **Distillation:** Removes salt from seawater (requires equipment)
5. **Magical purification:** *Purify Food and Drink* spell (instant, reliable)

**What to look for when buying:**
- Crystal clear appearance (cloudiness indicates contamination)
- No smell whatsoever (any odor is a warning sign)
- Cool temperature (warm water spoils faster)
- Always taste before buying in bulk

**Regional notes:** City water quality varies dramatically. Waterdeep has excellent aqueducts - their water is safe. Rural wells are usually good if properly maintained. Stagnant water is always dangerous. In cities without good infrastructure, assume water needs treatment.

**Practical advice:** *A gallon of clean water is worth more than a gallon of cheap ale in the desert. Price everything by context, not just market rates.*

### Fresh Cow's Milk
**Rarity:** Common | **Price:** 5 cp per gallon | **Weight:** 8.6 lbs per gallon | **Uses:** 16 (8 oz per use) | **Type:** Drink

**What you're buying:** Fresh milk from dairy cattle, unpasteurized.

**Unidentified appearance:** Opaque white liquid, cream rises to top if left standing.

**Storage:**
- **VERY perishable** - this cannot be overstated
- Keep as cold as possible (refrigerate or cool cellar)
- Shelf life: 1-2 days without refrigeration, 5-7 days refrigerated
- Goes sour very quickly in warm weather
- Souring accelerates exponentially in heat

**Usage notes:**
- One use = 8 oz (one cup) serving
- Highly nutritious (protein, calcium, fats)
- Essential for children and infants
- Many adult cultures don't consume milk after childhood

**Preparation tips:**
- Best consumed fresh and cold
- Can be cooked into porridge, soups, or sauces
- Curdles when combined with acid (lemon, vinegar) - use intentionally for cheese
- Boiling extends shelf life by 1 day (kills bacteria)
- Sour milk can still be used in baking (makes tender goods)

**What to look for when buying:**
- Fresh, sweet smell (any sourness means it's turning)
- Pure white color (cream on top is normal and desirable)
- No chunks, clumps, or separation beyond cream rising
- Buy only from trusted dairies with clean operations

**Preservation options:**
- Make cheese (lasts months when properly aged)
- Make butter (lasts weeks when salted)
- Make yogurt (lasts 1 week refrigerated)

**Regional notes:** Common in pastoral regions with grazing land. More expensive in large cities due to transport challenges. Very perishable - buy daily if possible. Some cultures (particularly in warm climates) don't consume fresh milk, preferring fermented dairy products.

**Professional reality:** *Milk is a daily-purchase item in summer. Any tavern trying to stock more than one day's supply in warm weather is asking for waste and spoilage. In winter, you might get 3-4 days. Plan accordingly.*

### Goat's Milk
**Rarity:** Common | **Price:** 8 cp per gallon | **Weight:** 8.6 lbs per gallon | **Uses:** 16 | **Type:** Drink

**What you're buying:** Fresh milk from dairy goats.

**Unidentified appearance:** White liquid, slightly different consistency than cow's milk.

**Storage:**
- Same as cow's milk (very perishable)
- Shelf life: 1-2 days without refrigeration

**Usage notes:**
- Similar nutritional value to cow's milk but different flavor profile
- Easier to digest for some people (smaller fat molecules)
- Common in regions where cows can't graze easily
- Often preferred for cheese-making (better texture, stronger flavor)

**What to look for when buying:**
- Fresh smell (goat milk has a distinctive but not unpleasant odor - this is normal)
- Pure white color
- No sourness or off-flavors

**Regional notes:** Common in mountainous or rocky areas where goats thrive but cattle struggle. More expensive than cow's milk due to smaller yields per animal. Makes excellent cheese - many premium cheeses are goat milk.

**Practical note:** *Goat's milk tastes "goaty" to people who aren't used to it. That's the actual flavor, not spoilage. City folk often reject it, rural and mountain folk prefer it. Know your customer base.*

---

### Buttermilk
**Rarity:** Common | **Price:** 3 cp per gallon | **Weight:** 8.6 lbs per gallon | **Uses:** 16 | **Type:** Drink

**What you're buying:** Tangy liquid left over from butter-making, or cultured milk product.

**Unidentified appearance:** Thick white liquid, consistency between milk and cream.

**Storage:**
- More stable than fresh milk (already cultured)

- Tangy smell is normal (it's supposed to be sour)

**Usage notes:**
- Tangy, sour taste (acquired taste for drinking)
- Thicker consistency than regular milk
- Excellent in baking (makes tender biscuits, pancakes, cakes)
- Refreshing drink in some cultures (especially Southern regions)

**Preparation tips:**
- Outstanding for pancakes and biscuits (chemical reaction with baking soda)
- Tenderizes meat in marinades (acid breaks down proteins)

- Used in cold soups in summer

**What to look for when buying:**
- Thick, pourable consistency
- Tangy smell is normal and expected
- No mold or unusual colors
- Should be uniformly textured

**Regional notes:** Byproduct of butter-making, so it's cheap and widely available in dairy regions. Less perishable than fresh milk. Popular in rural areas where dairy is abundant.

**Economic reality:** *Buttermilk is what's left after you make butter. It's essentially free to the dairy farmer, so pricing it too high marks you as greedy. Keep it cheap, move volume.*

---

### Coffee (Cup)
**Rarity:** Common | **Price:** 2 cp per cup | **Weight:** 0.5 lbs per cup (8 oz) | **Uses:** 1 | **Type:** Drink

**What you're buying:** Hot brewed beverage from roasted coffee beans.

- Never store brewed coffee - make fresh

**Usage notes:**
- Contains caffeine (provides alertness, focus)
- Bitter flavor (often sweetened with sugar or honey)
- Morning ritual for many people
- Mildly addictive (caffeine dependency)

**Preparation tips:**
- Grind beans fresh for best flavor
- Use boiling water (205-210°F ideal)

**Bulk purchasing options:**
- Whole beans: 5 sp per pound (about 40 cups worth)
- Ground coffee: 4 sp per pound (goes stale faster - only if using immediately)
- Pre-brewed: Always buy by the cup (doesn't keep)

**Regional notes:** Calishite import originally, now grown in southern regions. Extremely popular in cities where it's a morning staple. Coffee houses serve as social hubs. More expensive than tea due to growing requirements. Working professionals depend on it.

**Professional insight:** *Coffee drinkers are loyal and daily customers. A tavern that serves good morning coffee will have regulars. Serve yesterday's coffee and they'll go elsewhere permanently.*

---

### Tea (Cup)
**Rarity:** Common | **Price:** 1 cp per cup | **Weight:** 0.5 lbs per cup (8 oz) | **Uses:** 1 | **Type:** Drink

- Universal beverage across all cultures

**Common varieties:**
- **Black tea:** Fully oxidized, strong flavor, traditional
- **Green tea:** Unoxidized, lighter, more delicate
- **Herbal tea:** Not true tea, various medicinal plants

**Preparation tips:**
- Use boiling water for black tea
- Use cooler water (170-180°F) for green tea
- Steep 3-5 minutes (longer = more bitter)
- Can re-steep leaves (subsequent brews weaker)
- Over-steeping makes tea bitter and unpleasant

**Bulk purchasing options:**
- Loose leaves: 1 sp per pound (100+ cups)
- Quality varies enormously
- Cheap tea is harsh and bitter
- Good tea is smooth and complex

**Regional notes:** Truly universal beverage. Cheaper than coffee. Kara-Tur produces the finest teas. Essential social beverage in all cultures. Used medicinally for various ailments. Every household drinks tea.

**Market reality:** *Tea is cheap, universal, and has massive quality variation. Stock both cheap tea for common folk and premium tea for those willing to pay. Premium tea costs 20 times more but some customers will pay.*

---

### Hot Chocolate
**Rarity:** Uncommon | **Price:** 5 cp per cup | **Weight:** 0.5 lbs per cup (8 oz) | **Uses:** 1 | **Type:** Drink

**What you're buying:** Hot drink made from chocolate or cocoa powder, usually with milk.

**Unidentified appearance:** Dark brown creamy liquid.

**Storage:**

- Completely smooth texture (not grainy)
- Rich chocolate smell
- Good balance of sweet and chocolate flavor

**Regional notes:** Maztica import makes chocolate expensive. This is a luxury drink. Popular in wealthy households and upscale establishments. Traditional winter specialty. Children love it but it's expensive for daily consumption.

**Pricing reality:** *Chocolate costs real money. Don't underprice this or you'll lose profit. Wealthy customers expect to pay for luxury, and hot chocolate is luxury.*

---

### Fruit Juice (Cup)
**Rarity:** Common | **Price:** 3 cp per cup | **Weight:** 0.5 lbs per cup (8 oz) | **Uses:** 1 | **Type:** Drink

**What you're buying:** Fresh-pressed juice from various fruits.

**Unidentified appearance:** Colored liquid depending on fruit source.

**Common types available:**
- **Apple cider:** Most common and cheapest (1-2 cp per cup)
- **Grape juice:** Common but ferments into wine if left (3 cp)
- **Orange juice:** Expensive, requires imported fruit (5 cp)
- **Berry juice:** Seasonal, highly perishable (4 cp)

**Storage:**
- Drink fresh (spoils in 1-2 days)
- Refrigerate for 3-5 days maximum
- Ferments into alcohol naturally (grape juice becomes wine)
- No long-term storage without fermentation

**Usage notes:**
- Nutritious (vitamins, natural sugars)
- High in natural sugars (energy source)
- Popular children's drink
- Expensive for everyday use (requires lots of fruit)

**What to look for when buying:**

- Appropriate color for fruit type (deep red for grape, orange for orange, etc.)
- Fresh fruit aroma

**Regional notes:** Apple cider is universal and affordable. Other juices are more expensive and depend on fruit availability. Winter pressing creates cider supply for the year. Summer fresh juices spoil very quickly. Juice is luxury compared to water or tea.

**Economic truth:** *Fruit juice requires pounds of fruit to make cups of juice. Price it accordingly or lose money. Apple cider is cheap because apples are abundant. Orange juice is expensive because oranges are imported.*

**What to look for when buying:**
- "Corked" wine smells like wet cardboard (spoiled - reject it)
- Young wine is harsh and acidic
- Aged wine is smooth and complex
- Region of origin matters enormously (Sembia, Amn, Tethyr are famous)

**Regional notes:** Southern regions produce most wine. Sembia is famous for reds. Tethyr for whites. Daily beverage in wine country, luxury in the north. Water diluted with wine is safer to drink than plain water (alcohol kills some bacteria).

**Wine economics:** *Table wine is cheap in wine regions, expensive in the north. A bottle that costs 2 silver in Amn might cost 5 silver in Neverwinter. Transportation and taxation matter.*

**Practical reality:** *Mead requires pounds of honey. Honey is expensive. Don't underprice mead or you'll lose money. This is a premium product, not a cheap alternative to ale.*

---

### Cider (Hard Cider)

---

**Regional notes:** Tropical and southern import. Sailor's staple beverage. Popular in coastal cities. Mixed with water on ships (prevents water spoilage in barrels, kills bacteria). Cheaper than whiskey, sweeter flavor profile.

**Naval economics:** *Rum is sailor's currency. Coastal taverns need good rum or sailors go elsewhere. Daily rum ration was standard on ships for centuries - it's not luxury, it's expectation.*

---

**Regional notes:** Novelty and challenge drink. Popular in taverns as a dare. Actually useful in extreme cold (warms effectively). Some medicinal use (improves circulation, clears sinuses). Not for casual drinking.

**Tavern management:** *Dragonfire cordial attracts the "I can handle anything" crowd. They order it to show off, regret it, then order milk to cool their mouth. Keep milk ready. Also, warn customers - you don't want lawsuits.*

### Mushroom Beer
**Rarity:** Uncommon | **Price:** 1 gp per pitcher | **Weight:** 4 lbs per pitcher | **Uses:** 4 | **Type:** Drink

- 2-3 weeks after opening

**Usage notes:**
- 5% alcohol content
- Earthy, unique flavor (very different from grain beer)
- Underdark specialty
- Acquired taste (most surface dwellers find it strange)

**What to look for when buying:**
- Pale, mushroom-colored appearance
- Earthy smell (should smell like mushrooms, not unpleasant)
- Buy from drow or deep dwarf brewers (they know the craft)

**Regional notes:** Underdark specialty. Brewed in regions where grain doesn't grow. Drow and deep dwarf staple beverage. Surface dwellers usually find it odd. Novelty item in surface taverns, daily drink in Underdark.

**Market positioning:** *Mushroom beer is for drow, deep dwarves, and curious adventurers. It's exotic on the surface. Price reflects rarity, not production cost.*

### Firewine
**Rarity:** Uncommon | **Price:** 10 gp per bottle | **Weight:** 2 lbs per bottle | **Uses:** 5 | **Type:** Drink

**What you're buying:** Wine fortified with strong spirits (port, sherry, or madeira style).

**Unidentified appearance:** Deep red to amber liquid, syrupy.

**Storage:**
- Indefinite (high alcohol content preserves it)

**Usage notes:**
- 18-20% alcohol content (higher than regular wine)
- Sweet and strong
- Dessert wine
- Expensive

**Firewine varieties:**
- **Port-style:** Sweet red, rich, full-bodied

- **Madeira-style:** Caramelized, complex, aged

**What to look for when buying:**
- Deep, rich color
- Sweet, intense aroma
- Syrupy texture (thicker than regular wine)
- Origin matters (southern regions produce best)

**Regional notes:** Southern production (Amn, Tethyr, Calimshan). Dessert wine served after meals. Expensive but ages indefinitely. Appropriate gift. Popular with nobility.

**Economic note:** *Fortified wines cost more to make (you're adding spirits to wine) but last forever. One bottle can provide 20-30 small servings. Price per serving, not per bottle.*

---

### Ice Wine
**Rarity:** Rare | **Price:** 15 gp per bottle | **Weight:** 2 lbs per bottle | **Uses:** 8 | **Type:** Drink

**What you're buying:** Sweet wine made from grapes frozen on the vine.

**Unidentified appearance:** Golden, syrupy liquid (honey-like).

**Storage:**
- Ages extremely well
- Can last decades if properly stored

**Usage notes:**
- 10-12% alcohol content
- Intensely sweet (concentrated sugars)
- Dessert wine
- Very expensive

**Production process (explains cost):**
- Grapes must freeze naturally on vine
- Pressed while frozen
- Water stays frozen as ice, sugar concentrates in liquid
- Tiny yields from each grape = extremely expensive
- Can only be made in specific cold climates

**What to look for when buying:**
- Golden color
- Honey-like thickness
- Intensely sweet flavor
- **Verify origin** (Icewind Dale, northern vineyards only)

**Regional notes:** Northern specialty. Icewind Dale produces the finest ice wine. Very expensive due to tiny production volumes. Dessert wine for special occasions. A single bottle is an appropriate gift for nobility.

**Production reality:** *You get about 1/10th the volume from frozen grapes versus fresh grapes. That's why ice wine costs 10 times more than regular wine. It's not markup, it's math.*

**Critical warning:** *At 50 gold per bottle, Elverquisst is frequently faked. Green food coloring and mint liqueur costs 5 silver, sells for 50 gold if you're dishonest. Then angry adventurers with swords come back. Always verify with Detect Magic before purchasing stock.*

---

**Practical market advice:** *Warriors pay for Liquid Courage before battles. Stock it if you're near a war zone, dungeon entrance, or military base. Elsewhere it's overpriced novelty.*

---

### Moonwell Water
**Rarity:** Rare | **Price:** 50 gp per vial | **Weight:** 0.1 lbs per vial | **Uses:** 1 | **Type:** Drink

**Religious reality:** *Temples don't usually sell Moonwell Water to taverns. They give it to pilgrims or sell it directly to those in need. If someone offers you bulk Moonwell Water, it's probably fake.*

**Dragon economics:** *Getting a dragon to cooperate with ale-making is expensive and difficult. That's why this costs 40 gold per bottle. It's not overpriced - it's accurately priced for the difficulty of production.*

---

**Practical utility:** *Ethereal Wine is useful for ghost hunting and detecting ethereal assassins. Market it to paranoid wealthy customers and adventurers, not tavern regulars.*

**Legal warning:** *Feywine impairs judgment even more than alcohol. Customers who drink Feywine make terrible decisions. Keep an eye on them. If fights break out, you're liable in some cities.*

**Adventurer economics:** *Healing potions cost 50 gp and heal 2d4+2. Healing Honey Mead costs 60 gp per bottle, provides 5 servings healing 1d8+2 each. Adventurers will do the math. This is actually a good deal for them.*

**Utility pricing:** *Starlight Nectar provides 4 hours of darkvision. A *Darkvision* spell lasts 8 hours but requires a caster. For parties without darkvision, this is worth 80 gold.*

---

## LEGENDARY BEVERAGES

- **Usually not available for purchase** (divine gifts only)

**Regional notes:** Divine creation. Almost never available for purchase. Usually quest rewards or divine gifts. Stated price is theoretical - rarely sold. If offered for sale, verify authenticity extensively (almost certainly fake).

**Reality check:** *If someone offers you Ambrosia for 500 gold, it's fake. Gods don't sell Ambrosia through merchants. It's given to heroes and pilgrims. If you somehow acquire genuine Ambrosia, it's worth far more than 500 gold.*

---

**Professional advice:** *DO NOT STOCK ICHOR. DO NOT SELL ICHOR. If someone offers you Ichor, report them to temples. This is stolen divine essence. Possessing it risks divine retribution. Not worth any amount of money.*

---

### Waters of Life
**Rarity:** Legendary | **Price:** Priceless | **Weight:** 0 | **Uses:** 1 | **Type:** Mythological

**What you're buying:** You're not - this is mythological.

**Mythological properties:**
- Grants immortality (allegedly)
- Restores complete youth (allegedly)

- Divine prohibition against mortal use

**Regional notes:** Creation myth. Fountain of Youth legend. Various cultures have legends of Waters of Life. If it exists, it's not accessible to mortals. DO NOT PURSUE.

**Reality:** *Waters of Life is mythology. Every generation has treasure hunters seeking it. None return successful. It's either myth or guarded by powers that kill seekers. Either way, not a product you'll stock.*

---

### The Last Drop
**Rarity:** Legendary | **Price:** Priceless | **Weight:** 0 | **Uses:** 1 | **Type:** Mythological/Cursed

**Cultural purpose:** *The Last Drop is a teaching story. "Don't be greedy or you'll get The Last Drop." It's not a real product. If someone claims to sell it, they're either lying or selling poison.*

## FINAL NOTES FROM HELENA

*After 32 years selling beverages, here's what matters:*

**Water Quality First:** Bad water kills more people than bad food. Verify sources. When in doubt, boil it. A provisioner who sells clean water builds reputation. One who doesn't builds graveyards.

**Know Storage Times:** Fresh milk: 1-2 days. Ale: 2 weeks. Spirits: forever. Price accordingly and manage inventory or lose money to spoilage.

**Alcohol is Medicine:** In many regions, small ale is safer than water. This isn't about drunkenness - it's about dysentery prevention. The working class drinks ale all day because water kills.

**Quality Ranges:** Every category has quality variation. Cheap gin is poison. Good gin is respectable. The difference is distillation quality, not ingredients. Know your suppliers.

**Magical Verification:** If it glows, phases, or grants powers, verify with *Detect Magic* before purchase. Fakes are epidemic. Your reputation depends on selling authentic magical beverages.

**Price by Context:** Water is free in Waterdeep, worth gold in deserts. Ice wine costs 15 gold in Icewind Dale, 50 gold in Calimshan. Everything is regional.

**Divine Items Aren't For Sale:** If someone offers Ambrosia, Ichor, or Waters of Life, they're lying or committing blasphemy. Divine beverages are gifts from gods, not commercial products. Don't stock them.

May your water be clean, your ale be fresh, and your customers be satisfied.
