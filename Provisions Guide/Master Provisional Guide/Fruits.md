# FRUITS
## The Master Provisioner's Guide to Tree Fruits, Berries, Citrus, and Tropical Imports

*Fresh fruit is essential for preventing scurvy on long journeys, provides quick energy, and keeps morale high when rations get monotonous. Smart provisioners know the difference between what needs to be fresh, what should be dried, and what's pure status symbol.*

## CRITICAL PRESERVATION NOTE

Most fruits spoil quickly. For long expeditions:
- **Bring dried fruits** (indefinite storage, concentrated nutrition)
- **Bring fruit preserves** (jams, jellies - long shelf life)
- **Bring citrus** (stores longer than most fresh fruits)
- **Avoid fresh berries** (1-3 days maximum, not practical)

Fresh berries spoil in days and cost a fortune out of season. Dried fruits store for years and travel well. Exotic imports like pineapples are pure status symbols - you're paying 95% for transport and bragging rights.

**A good provisioner knows when fresh is worth the premium, when dried is smarter, and when you're just showing off. Usually it's the dried fruit that makes sense.**

## HELENA'S FINAL THOUGHTS ON FRUITS

*Apples store for months and cost a few copper. Dried apricots travel well and last years. Pineapples cost ten gold pieces, spoil in days, and you're paying for the ability to say you served a pineapple.*

*Fresh berries are for rich people who can afford to throw food away when it molds on day three. Dried fruit is for professionals who need food that works.*

*Citrus is worth the premium on long voyages - scurvy will kill your crew faster than storms will. The rest of the exotic fruit? Pure status symbols. Dragon fruit for fifteen gold pieces? You're not buying food, you're buying a conversation topic.*

*Know the difference. Buy fresh local fruit when it's in season and cheap. Buy dried fruit for storage and expeditions. Buy exotic imports when your customer is paying for prestige, not nutrition.*

**Usually it's the dried fruit that makes sense.**
