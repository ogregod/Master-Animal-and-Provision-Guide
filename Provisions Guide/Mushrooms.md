# MUSHROOMS
## The Master Provisioner's Guide to Fungi - Cultivated, Wild, and Magical

*Fungi of all types, from common to magical. Handle mushrooms with respect - many are edible, some are medicinal, and a few will kill you faster than poison. When in doubt, don't eat it.*

## CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING

**⚠️ NEVER FORAGE WILD MUSHROOMS WITHOUT EXPERT IDENTIFICATION ⚠️**

Many deadly mushrooms closely resemble edible varieties. One mistake can be fatal. I don't care how experienced you think you are - every year I hear about "expert" foragers who misidentified a destroying angel and died screaming.

**Buy from trusted foragers with verified credentials, or stick to cultivated varieties.**

The money you save on cheap wild mushrooms isn't worth your life. And if you're sourcing for a tavern or expedition, remember: **poisoning your customers is bad for business and often illegal.**

## HELENA'S FINAL THOUGHTS ON MUSHROOMS

*CRITICAL WARNING: Wild mushrooms can kill you.*

I don't care how experienced you think you are - every year I hear about "expert" foragers who misidentified a destroying angel and died screaming. Buy from trusted foragers with verified credentials, or stick to cultivated varieties.

The money you save on cheap wild mushrooms isn't worth your life. And if you're sourcing for a tavern or expedition, remember: **poisoning your customers is bad for business and often illegal.**

**Cultivated varieties** (button, cremini, portobello, oyster, shiitake) are safe, reliable, and available year-round. They're what most taverns should stock.

**Wild varieties** require expert identification. If you're buying wild mushrooms, verify your forager's credentials, ask where they were harvested, and when in doubt, don't buy.

**Dried and preserved mushrooms** are concentr ated flavor bombs with excellent storage life. A little goes a long way. They're worth the premium for professional kitchens.

**Magical mushrooms** with game mechanics are real, but expensive and often dangerous. Verify everything with *Detect Magic* before paying rare-item prices. Half the "magical mushrooms" on the market are frauds.
