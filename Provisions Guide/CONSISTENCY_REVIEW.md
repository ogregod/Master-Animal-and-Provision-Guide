### Weight-to-Uses Calculations Verified

**Grains:**
- Hard wheat: 10 lbs, 40 uses = 4 oz/use ✓
- Soft wheat: 10 lbs, 40 uses = 4 oz/use ✓

- Wild rice: 2 lbs, 12 uses = 2.67 oz/use (very filling, dense) ✓

**Salts & Spices:**
- Fine sea salt: 1 lb, 96 uses = 0.167 oz/use (~1 tsp) ✓
- Black peppercorns: 0.25 lbs, 48 uses = 0.083 oz/use (~1 tsp whole) ✓
- Pink mountain salt: 0.5 lbs, 40 uses = 0.2 oz/use (~1 tsp) ✓

**Vegetables:**
- Yellow onions: 1 lb, 3 uses = 5.3 oz/use (~1 onion) ✓

## Realism and Honesty ✓

### Realistic Elements

**Economic Realism:**
- Import costs justified (transport, spoilage risk)
- Seasonal pricing variations noted
- Labor-intensive items priced higher (hand-harvested)
- Bulk vs specialty pricing makes sense

**Storage Realism:**
- Actual shelf life for each item
- Proper storage conditions specified
- Spoilage warnings where appropriate
- Fresh vs dried preservation differences

**Usage Realism:**
- Portion sizes match actual consumption
- Waste factors acknowledged
- Preparation requirements noted
- Professional vs home use distinguished

### Honest Elements

**Admits Limitations:**
- "I'm a provisioner, not a wizard" (no alchemy coverage)
- "I buy ingredients, I don't grow them" (no farming tips)
- Grains section omission acknowledged as "embarrassing"

**Economic Honesty:**
- "Exotic imports are pure status symbols"
- "You're paying 95% for transport"
- "Baby greens are wildly overpriced"
- Clear about when luxury is worth it vs vanity

**Safety Honesty:**
- Doesn't downplay mushroom poisoning danger
- "Every year I hear about 'expert' foragers who died"
- Doesn't pretend professional knowledge is easy to acquire
- Clear about risks to business and lives

**Realism & Honesty:** ✓ Maintained throughout

## Regional Integration ✓

### D&D Lore Consistency

**Established Locations Used:**
- Goldenfields (agricultural center, Chauntea temples)
- Waterdeep (import hub, major city)
- Baldur's Gate (trade city, southern connections)
- Trielta Hills (garlic/shallot region)
- Daggerford (farming valley)
- Silverymoon (northern city)
- Candlekeep (scholarly imports)
- Moonshae Isles (wild foraging, unique ecosystem)
- Cormyr (quality agriculture)
- Dalelands (potato country)

**Trade Route Logic:**
- Southern imports through Waterdeep/Baldur's Gate
- Northern specialties from Silverymoon
- Wild foraging from Moonshae
- Distant exotics (Calimshan, Kara-Tur, Chult, Maztica) appropriately expensive

**Climate Logic:**
- Cold-weather crops in north (rye, root vegetables)
- Delicate crops near cities (glasshouse lemons)
- Wild rice from lake regions
- Tropical imports extremely expensive

**Regional Integration:** ✓ Lore-appropriate
