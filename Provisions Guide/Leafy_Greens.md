# LEAFY GREENS
## The Master Provisioner's Guide to Fresh Vegetables, Cabbages, and Salad Materials

*Fresh vegetables don't keep long, but they're essential for balanced meals and preventing scurvy on long journeys. A provisioner who only stocks one type of lettuce or cabbage is marking themselves as amateur. Professional buyers need to understand the difference between varieties - not just for flavor, but for storage life, price, and customer expectations.*

## About This Category

Leafy greens are your perishable stock. They range from hardy cabbages that store for months to delicate lettuces that wilt in days. Understanding storage characteristics, variety differences, and seasonal availability is crucial for any professional provisioner.

**Professional buyers should know:**
- Basic lettuces (iceberg, butterhead, leaf) serve different purposes
- Cabbage varieties have dramatically different storage lives
- Cooking greens (kale, collards, chard) must be prepared differently than salad greens
- Wild and foraged greens are seasonal and location-dependent
- Specialty varieties command premium prices for good reasons

**Common uses:**
- Fresh salads and slaws
- Cooked side dishes
- Soup and stew ingredients
- Wraps and garnishes
- Fermented preservation (sauerkraut, kimchi)

## HELENA'S FINAL THOUGHTS ON LEAFY GREENS

*Iceberg lettuce is cheap, reliable, and stores well - perfect for taverns feeding hundreds. Butterhead lettuce is delicate, expensive, and spoils in days - perfect for noble house dinners where presentation matters. Baby greens are wildly overpriced unless you're trying to impress someone. Collard greens are peasant food that happens to be nutritious and filling.*

*Know the difference between varieties, buy accordingly, and for the love of all the gods, don't let your delicate salad greens sit unwashed in a warm kitchen. They'll be slime before lunch.*

*Wild greens are either free food if you know what you're doing, or a trip to the healer if you don't. If you're selling foraged greens, know your source. Poisoning your customers is bad for business and often illegal.*

*The magical varieties with game mechanics are real, but verify everything. Half the "Moonlit Watercress" on the market is regular watercress with a *Light* cantrip. Test it properly before paying rare-item prices.*
