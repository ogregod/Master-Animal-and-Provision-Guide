### 🌾 GRAINS & CEREALS

**Core Coverage:** NOT in original guide - this is NEW content

**Why this expansion matters:** I can't believe I published five editions without a proper grains section. Grains are the backbone of provisioning - they store well, travel well, and turn into bread, porridge, beer, and a hundred other necessities. This was a glaring omission.

## How to Provision Efficiently

### For Tavern Keepers

**Essential Staples (restock weekly):**
- Common grains: Hard wheat, oats, barley
- Common roots: Yellow onions, garlic, brown potatoes, carrots
- Common greens: Iceberg lettuce, cabbage, basic cooking greens
- Common herbs: Dried thyme, rosemary, basic salt and pepper

**Specialty Items (restock monthly or as needed):**
- Specialty flours for fine baking
- Red or sweet onions for upscale dishes
- Specialty mushrooms for premium menu items
- Seasonal fresh herbs

### For Adventuring Parties

**Lightweight, Long Storage:**
- Dried fruits (high nutrition, low weight)
- Whole grains (can be cooked with water)
- Dried mushroom powder (flavor without bulk)
- Salt and basic spices (preservation and taste)

**Avoid:**
- Fresh greens (spoil quickly, low nutrition for weight)
- Fresh mushrooms (spoil quickly)
- Whole potatoes (heavy, better options exist)

### For Army Quartermasters

**Bulk Provisioning Priorities:**
1. **Grains:** Hard wheat, barley, oats - store well, high nutrition
2. **Roots:** Potatoes, turnips, onions - hardy, filling, cheap
3. **Preserved:** Dried fruits, salted meats, hard cheeses
4. **Basics:** Rock salt (cheapest), dried herbs, basic spices

**Calculate:** 1.5 lbs grain + 1 lb vegetables per soldier per day

### For Noble House Provisioners

**Maintain Variety:**
- 3-4 onion varieties (yellow, red, sweet, shallots)
- 2-3 potato varieties (brown, red, fingerling)
- Full spice complement (all pepper types, specialty salts)
- Seasonal fresh items (demonstrating connections and wealth)
- Occasional luxury imports (pineapple, truffles, exotic fruits)

**Quality over quantity** - source from named regions, pay premium prices

## Seasonal Provisioning Calendar

### Spring (Planting Season)
**Abundant:** Wild foraged greens, early lettuce, radishes, garlic scapes
**Scarce:** Winter storage items running low
**Strategy:** Pay premium for fresh, stretch remaining storage crops

### Summer (Growing Season)
**Abundant:** Fresh herbs, leafy greens, berries, early vegetables
**Scarce:** Grains (between harvests)
**Strategy:** Preserve summer abundance, stock up on fresh items

### Fall (Harvest Season)
**Abundant:** Grains, root vegetables, late fruits, storage crops
**Scarce:** Nothing - peak season
**Strategy:** BUY IN BULK, stock root cellars, dry and preserve

### Winter (Storage Season)
**Abundant:** Storage roots, dried goods, preserved items
**Scarce:** Fresh greens, fresh fruits, fresh herbs
**Strategy:** Rely on storage, pay premium for fresh items, plan for spring

## Final Notes from Helena

If you've made it this far, you understand something important: provisioning isn't just about buying food. It's about understanding seasons, trade routes, storage, and the fundamental economics of feeding people.

The prices in these guides are Waterdeep standard, 1492 DR. They'll change with seasons, regions, and market conditions. Use your head. Build relationships with reliable suppliers. Know when you're getting a good price and when you're being robbed.

Most importantly: **feed people well**. Whether it's an army, a tavern, or an adventuring party, the quality of your provisions affects everything. Good food keeps morale high, health good, and work efficient. Cheap provisioning is expensive provisioning when your people are sick, weak, or dead.

These guides represent thirty-two years of work. Use them well.
