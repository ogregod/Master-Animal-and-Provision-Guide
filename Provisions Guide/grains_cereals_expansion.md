# PART II: GRAINS & CEREALS
## The Foundation of Every Kitchen

*I can't believe I published five editions without a proper grains section. Must be getting old. Well, here's thirty-two years of grain knowledge, from the mills of Goldenfields to the specialty importers of Waterdeep. - Helena*

Grains are the backbone of civilization. They store well, travel well, and turn into bread, porridge, beer, and a hundred other necessities. If you're feeding people, you need to understand grain.

**Key principles for grain buying:**
- Buy whole grains when possible (longer storage, better nutrition)
- Check for pests (weevils love grain stores)
- Know your miller (good grinding makes good flour)
- Understand moisture content (wet grain spoils, dry grain stores)

## COMMON GRAINS

**Usage notes:**
- One use = 1/4 cup of berries or 1/3 cup flour when ground
