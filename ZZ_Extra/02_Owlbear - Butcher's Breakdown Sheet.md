# Owlbear - Butcher's Breakdown Sheet
**Quick Reference Guide for Processing "That Damn Feathered Bear"**

---

## Animal Specifications

- Live weight: ~1,600 lbs (estimated)
- Blood removed (field): 128 lbs (8% of live weight)
- Viscera removed (field): 52 lbs (digestive tract + non-magical organs)
- **Dressed weight** (arrives at shop): 1,420 lbs (with hide still attached)
- **Carcass weight** (after external materials): 1,237 lbs

**Important:** Hunters should field dress the owlbear and deliver it WITH magical organs preserved separately in ice/alcohol.

---

## The Two Halves - CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING

⚠️ **Owlbears are TWO different animals in one body:**
- **Top half (avian/bird)**: Dark red, VERY lean, tastes like venison + duck
- **Bottom half (ursine/bear)**: Rich, fatty, marbled, tastes like wild boar

❌ **DO NOT cook them the same way** - you'll ruin one half!

---

## AVIAN HALF (Chest & Wings) - 240 lbs

### The Pectorals (Chest - 170 lbs)

**What it is:** The crushing muscles from the breastbone to shoulders. When an owlbear hugs you to death, these are doing the work.

| Cut | Quantity | Unit Weight | Total Weight | Price Each | Total Value | Cooking Method |
|-----|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Owlbear Filet** (inner pectoral) | 24 steaks | 3 lbs | 72 lbs | 6 gp | 144 gp | Sear RARE (3-4 min/side), rest 5 min |
| **Hunter's Steak** (outer pectoral) | 33 steaks | 2 lbs | 66 lbs | 2 gp | 66 gp | Marinate 4+ hrs, grill medium-rare |
| **Pectoral Trim** (edges/scraps) | Bulk | 32 lbs | 32 lbs | 16 gp total | 16 gp | Stir fry, stew, kebabs |
| **TOTAL PECTORALS** | | | **170 lbs** | | **226 gp** | |

**Critical Notes:**
- Owlbear Filet is THE money cut - stupid tender, worth 6 gp per steak
- Cook to RARE or MEDIUM RARE ONLY - overcooking = boot leather
- Very lean meat, almost NO intramuscular fat
- High in iron - tastes metallic if overcooked

---

### The Wings (Forearms - 70 lbs)

**What it is:** Huge muscular arms with vestigial feathers. NOT like chicken wings. More like bear forearms.

| Cut | Quantity | Unit Weight | Total Weight | Price Each | Total Value | Cooking Method |
|-----|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Wing Flats** (bone-in sections) | 14 pieces | 5 lbs | 70 lbs | 5 sp | 7 gp | Smoke 12+ hrs OR braise in beer/vegetables 6+ hrs |

**Critical Notes:**
- Extremely tough connective tissue - SO MUCH COLLAGEN
- Only TWO cooking methods: low & slow smoke OR low & slow braise
- DO NOT try to grill these - you will break teeth
- Fall-off-the-bone tender when cooked right (12+ hours)
- Makes incredible stock due to gelatin content

---

## URSINE HALF (Legs, Back, Belly) - 335 lbs

### The Saddle (Back & Loin - 80 lbs)

**What it is:** The meat along the spine, protected by ribcage. Premium bear cuts.

| Cut | Quantity | Unit Weight | Total Weight | Price Each | Total Value | Cooking Method |
|-----|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Grizzly T-Bone** (short loin) | 13 steaks | 3 lbs | 39 lbs | 4 gp | 52 gp | Sear hard, salt & pepper only, serve proud |
| **Ribeye Steak** (front ribs) | 22 steaks | 1.5 lbs | 33 lbs | 2 gp | 44 gp | Cast iron, high heat, generous salt |
| **Tenderloin** (hidden inside ribcage) | 2 roasts | 4 lbs | 8 lbs | 24 gp* | 48 gp* | Butcher's cut - KEEP IT (or sell for 30 gp each) |
| **TOTAL SADDLE** | | | **80 lbs** | | **144 gp** | |

**\*Tenderloin tradition:** Every butcher keeps the tenderloin. This isn't greed - it's tradition. You did the skilled work. It's the best cut. Take it home and remember why you do this job.

**Critical Notes:**
- Fat marbling throughout (12% fat in ursine half)
- Rich, sweet game meat - tastes like premium wild boar
- Tenderloin is soft as butter, melts in your mouth
- These cuts are what make owlbear famous

---

### The Haunches (Hind Legs - 160 lbs)

**What it is:** The working muscles. Dense, needs slow cooking.

| Cut | Quantity | Unit Weight | Total Weight | Price Each | Total Value | Cooking Method |
|-----|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Iron Roast** (top round) | 10 roasts | 10 lbs | 100 lbs | 5 gp | 50 gp | Braise low & slow with vegetables & dark beer (6+ hrs) |
| **Leg Steak** (bottom round) | 20 steaks | 1 lb | 20 lbs | 1 gp | 20 gp | Quick-cooking, good for stew |
| **Shank** (lower leg, bone-in) | 8 shanks | 5 lbs | 40 lbs | 1 gp | 8 gp | Cross-cut for marrow, simmer 3+ hrs |
| **TOTAL HAUNCHES** | | | **160 lbs** | | **78 gp** | |

**Critical Notes:**
- Iron Roast feeds 8-12 people - huge roasts tied with twine
- Shanks are "peasant food" but incredible if cooked right
- Marrow in the shanks is worth the effort
- All cuts benefit from long, slow cooking

---

### The Belly & Flank (95 lbs)

**What it is:** Layers of fat and meat (like pork belly) plus lower abdominal muscles.

| Cut | Quantity | Unit Weight | Total Weight | Price Each | Total Value | Cooking Method |
|-----|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Green Bacon** (whole belly slabs) | 5 slabs | 10 lbs | 50 lbs | 10 gp | 50 gp | Cure 7 days, smoke 8 hrs (see bacon process below) |
| **Skirt Steak** (diaphragm) | 5 steaks | 2 lbs | 10 lbs | 1 gp | 5 gp | Grill FAST & HOT (90 sec/side), slice thin |
| **Brisket & Flank** (lower chest) | Bulk | 35 lbs | 35 lbs | 6 sp/lb | 21 gp | Long smoking or stewing |
| **TOTAL BELLY/FLANK** | | | **95 lbs** | | **76 gp** | |

**Critical Notes:**
- Green Bacon is what EVERYONE asks for - best bacon you'll ever have
- Skirt steak is deceptively tough - MUST cook fast & hot, then slice thin
- Brisket needs 12+ hours of smoking for proper texture

---

## GREEN BACON CURING PROCESS

**What is Green Bacon?**
"Green" means uncured/fresh. After curing it becomes bacon. Owlbear belly bacon is legendary.

### Curing Recipe (for 50 lbs belly)

**Dry Cure Method:**
| Ingredient | Amount Needed | Source | Cost |
|------------|---------------|--------|------|
| **Fine Sea Salt** | 10 lbs (20% salt packing) | Fine Sea Salt @ 3 cp/lb | 30 cp = 3 sp |
| Brown sugar (optional) | 2 lbs (adds sweetness) | Common sugar @ 5 cp/lb | 10 cp = 1 sp |
| Black pepper | 4 tbsp | Black Peppercorns (1 sp/pkg) | ~1 sp |
| Juniper berries (optional) | 2 tbsp | Juniper Berries (5 sp/pkg) | ~2 sp |
| **TOTAL COST** | | | **~7-8 sp for 50 lbs** |

### Curing Process (7-14 days):

1. **Day 0 - Prepare the cure:**
   - Mix salt, sugar, pepper, juniper berries
   - Calculate: 2.5% of belly weight in salt minimum (1.25 lbs), plus extra for packing

2. **Day 0-1 - Pack the bacon:**
   - Rub belly slabs generously with cure mixture
   - Pack in wooden box or crock, surrounded by salt
   - Cover with cloth, weight it down
   - Store in cold cellar (below 40°F)

3. **Days 2-7 - Cure:**
   - Liquid will draw out (brine)
   - Flip slabs every 2 days
   - Keep cold (critical!)
   - Minimum 7 days (10-14 days for thicker slabs)

4. **Day 7+ - Rinse:**
   - Remove from salt
   - Rinse thoroughly with cold water
   - Pat dry with clean cloth
   - Let air-dry for 2-4 hours (forms pellicle for smoke adhesion)

5. **Smoking (8-12 hours):**
   - Cold smoke at 150-180°F (NOT hot smoke - that cooks it)
   - Use hickory, apple, or oak wood
   - Smoke until mahogany brown color
   - Internal temp should reach 150°F

6. **Storage:**
   - Fresh (after smoking): 3 weeks refrigerated
   - Frozen: 6 months (wrap tightly)
   - Best quality: Use within 10 days

**Yield:** 50 lbs green bacon → 50 lbs cured bacon (minimal weight loss in dry cure method)

**Revenue:** 5 slabs × 10 gp each = 50 gp

**Net profit:** 50 gp revenue - 8 sp costs - 2 gp firewood = ~47 gp profit

---

## Byproducts & Value-Added Processing

### HUNTER'S SAUSAGE (70% lean / 30% owlbear tallow)

**Why owlbear tallow instead of pork fat?**
The bear-half produces clean, mild fat perfect for sausage. We use our OWN rendered tallow instead of buying pork fat. This saves money and uses every part of the carcass.

**Recipe:**
- Owlbear trim: 70 lbs (neck meat, rib scraps, leg edges)
- Owlbear tallow (rendered): 30 lbs (from our own fat trimmings)
- Total mixture: 100 lbs (70/30 ratio - standard for bear meat per General Guide)
- Processing loss (2%): 2 lbs
- **Final yield: 98 lbs** (261 six-ounce links)

**Price:**
- Bulk sale: 1 gp/lb = 98 gp
- Individual links: 5 sp each = 130.5 gp (more work)

**Sausage Spice Recipe (for 70 lbs meat / 7 batches):**

| Ingredient | Amount Needed | Cost (Retail) | Cost (Guild) |
|------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Daggerford Sage (fresh) | 10.5 tbsp (~2 bunches) | 6 sp | 4 sp |
| Juniper Berries | 7 tsp (~1 package) | 5 sp | 3 sp |
| Black Pepper (coarse ground) | 7 tsp (~1 package) | 1 sp | 6 cp |
| Trielta Hills Garlic | 28 cloves (~2 bulbs) | 4 cp | 4 cp |
| Fine Sea Salt | 18 lbs total* | 54 cp | 54 cp |
| Fennel Seed (optional) | 7 tsp (~1 package) | 4 sp | 4 sp |
| Natural hog casings | For 261 links | 3 gp | 3 gp |
| **TOTAL MATERIALS** | | **~5 gp** | **~4.5 gp** |

**\*Salt includes:** Sausage seasoning (14 tsp), bacon curing (50 lbs belly × 2.5% = 1.25 lbs), hide preservation (11.5 lbs), organ packing (5 lbs). See salt breakdown below.

**Net Profit:** 98 gp revenue - 0 gp fat cost (using own tallow) - 5 gp materials = **93 gp profit**

---

### MASTER'S GLACE (Concentrated Bone Stock)

**Ingredients:**
- Premium bones: 170 lbs (femurs, knuckles, neck vertebrae, meaty ribs)
- Water: 20 quarts start
- Aromatics: ~10 cp (see stock recipe below)

**Process:**
1. **Roast bones** at 425°F for 45 minutes (caramelization = deep flavor)
2. **Simmer** in 20 quarts water with aromatics for 24-36 hours
3. **Evaporation** during simmer: ~20% loss = 16 quarts remaining
4. **Strain** through cheesecloth, discard solids
5. **Reduce** by 50% = 8 quarts final Master's Glace

**Aromatics for Stock:**
| Ingredient | Amount | Source | Cost |
|------------|--------|--------|------|
| Sword Coast Yellow Onions | 1 onion (skin on) | 2 cp/bag | 1 cp |
| Silverymoon Carrots | 2 carrots | 5 cp/bunch | 3 cp |
| Celery | 2 ribs | 3 cp/bundle | 1 cp |
| Bay Leaves | 2 leaves | 3 sp/pkg | 4 cp |
| Black Peppercorns | 10 whole | Included in sausage purchase | ~0 cp |
| **TOTAL** | | | **~9 cp** |

**Yield:** 8 quarts Master's Glace (concentrated, coats spoon when cooled)

**Price:** 5 gp per quart

**Revenue:** 8 quarts × 5 gp = 40 gp

**Net profit:** 40 gp - 1 gp costs = **39 gp**

**Characteristics:**
- Deep brown color, sets to jelly when cold
- Intense savory flavor (umami bomb)
- Restorative properties (not magical, but feels like it)
- One cup warms you to your bones

**Storage:**
- Refrigerated: 1 week
- Frozen (jars): 6 months
- Dried into bouillon cubes: 1 year

---

### RENDERED TALLOW (Cooking Fat)

**Source:**
- Raw fat collected: 99 lbs (from trimming all cuts)
- Rendering loss (10%): 10 lbs (moisture evaporates, cracklings removed)
- **Yield: 89 lbs** finished tallow

**Allocation:**
- Reserved for sausage: 30 lbs (replaces pork fat purchase)
- Sold as cooking fat: 59 lbs × 2 sp/lb = 11.8 gp

**Rendering Process:**
1. Cut fat into 1-inch cubes
2. Place in large pot on low heat (200-250°F)
3. Melt slowly for 6-8 hours, stirring occasionally
4. Strain through cloth into jars while hot
5. Cool to solidify (golden liquid → creamy white solid)

**Uses:**
- Cooking fat (smoke point 420°F - better than butter for searing)
- Soap making (makes hard, long-lasting bars)
- Leather conditioning (waterproofs boots)
- Candle making (burns 3× longer than wax)
- Emergency lamp fuel

**The Cracklings:** Crispy bits left over after rendering. Sprinkle with salt, eat with beer. Butcher's snack.

## Salt Requirements & Costs

**Complete Salt Breakdown for One Owlbear:**

| Use | Calculation | Amount | Cost @ 3 cp/lb |
|-----|-------------|--------|----------------|
| **Sausage seasoning** | 2 tsp per 10 lbs × 7 batches | 0.15 lbs | ~1 cp |
| **Bacon curing** | 50 lbs belly × 2.5% dry cure | 1.25 lbs | 4 cp |
| **Hide preservation** | 115 lbs hide × 10% initial cure | 11.5 lbs | 35 cp |
| **Organ packing** | Magical organs for transport | 5 lbs | 15 cp |
| **TOTAL SALT NEEDED** | | **18 lbs** | **54 cp = 5 sp 4 cp** |

**Note:** If selling raw hide to tanner, they may provide salt (deducted from hide purchase price). If processing yourself, you pay for salt.

**Salt Source:** Fine Sea Salt @ 3 cp/lb (99_Tables reference)

---

## External Materials (Harvested First)

### The Hide (115 lbs) - "Feather-Leather"

**What it is:** Starts as thick bear leather (legs/belly), transitions to feathered weave (shoulders). Tanners make Cloaks of Protection from this.

**Value:**
- Bulk sale (as-is): 105 gp
- Processed & squared: 135 gp (more work, not usually worth your time)

**Removal:**
- Use SHARP knife
- Start at legs, work up
- DO NOT poke holes - every knife mark drops value
- Easier when carcass is warm (within 6 hours)
- After 6 hours it stiffens and fights you

**Critical:** Sold separately from meat processing. Deliver to tanner immediately after removal.

---

### The Plumage (Feathers - 8 lbs)

**Two types:**

| Type | Weight | Buyer | Uses | Price |
|------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| Stiff contour feathers | 5 lbs | Fletchers | 600+ arrows per owlbear | 30 gp |
| Down feathers | 3 lbs | Scribes, pillow-makers | Quills, pillows | 10 gp |
| **TOTAL** | **8 lbs** | | | **40 gp** |

**Critical:** Keep feathers DRY. Wet feathers = worth exactly nothing.

---

### Trophy Parts (35 lbs)

| Part | Weight | Buyer | Uses | Price |
|------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| The Beak | 18 lbs | Weaponsmiths, collectors | Pommels, wall mounts, druid rituals | 20 gp |
| The Talons | 17 lbs total | Weaponsmiths, apothecaries | Dagger hilts, ground for medicine | 10 gp |
| **TOTAL** | **35 lbs** | | | **30 gp** |

**How to prepare:**
- Cut at the joint (clean cuts)
- Clean with vinegar or they'll rot and stink up your shop
- Learn from my mistakes

---

### Arcane Viscera - HARVEST FIRST! (25 lbs)

⚠️ **CRITICAL TIMING:** Extract within 30 minutes of death or they lose alchemical potency!

| Organ | Weight | Alchemical Use | Preservation | Value |
|-------|--------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Heart | 8 lbs | Potions of Heroism | Alcohol, salt brine, or ice | 25 gp total |
| Liver (both lobes) | 14 lbs | Antitoxins, poison resistance | Same | (all 4 organs) |
| Eyes (both) | 2.5 lbs | Darkvision, sometimes True Seeing | Same | |
| Gall Bladder | 0.5 lbs | Transformation magic | Same | |
| **TOTAL** | **25 lbs** | | | **25 gp fresh** |

**If NOT fresh:** 5 gp as "practice materials" (80% value loss!)

**Preservation methods:**
- High-proof alcohol (cheap stuff is fine)
- Salt brine
- Ice (if in field)

**Critical:** Pack in cold chest immediately. Time = money here.

## Critical Warnings

### ⚠️ THE MUSK GLAND - DO NOT PUNCTURE THIS! ⚠️

**Location:** Base of tail, where spine meets pelvis. Walnut-sized, yellowish-tan, buried in fat.

**What happens if punctured:**
- Releases skunk-fire oil that SOAKS INTO MEAT
- Ruins 50-75 lbs of meat instantly (everything within 2 feet)
- Smell: burning skunk hair + rancid oil
- Taste: impossibly bitter, causes gagging
- **Value loss: 50-150 gp**
- CANNOT be saved by washing, soaking, or cooking

**How to avoid disaster:**
1. FIND THE GLAND FIRST before cutting hindquarters
2. Mark it with chalk
3. Use SHARP knife to cut it out in 3-inch circle (safety margin)
4. Throw it away immediately, FAR from work area
5. Wash hands and knife with vinegar

**Personal note from Garrick:** "I once had an apprentice nick this gland while cutting the hindquarters. The smell was so bad we had to close the shop for two days. The meat was completely unsalvageable - even dogs wouldn't eat it. I lost 150 gold because he was in a hurry. He's not my apprentice anymore."

---

### The Gizzard Stones (Free Treasure!)

**What is it:** Owlbears swallow stones to grind food in a muscular pouch (gizzard) near the throat.

**Where to find:** Upper digestive tract, between stomach and crop. Cantaloupe-sized muscular sac.

**What to do:**
1. Cut it open carefully
2. Sift through contents with gloved hands
3. Wash all stones/objects thoroughly
4. Check for magic items (use Identify spell on jewelry)

**What you might find:**

| Chance | Items | Value |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Common (rolls 1-10) | River stones, quartz, granite | Worthless (good sling ammunition) |
| Uncommon (11-15) | Old coins, belt buckles, arrowheads | 1-5 gp (scrap metal) |
| Rare (16-19) | Semiprecious gems (agate, jasper, turquoise) | 10-50 gp |
| Very Rare (20) | Magic rings, amulets, jewelry | 100-500+ gp |

**Garrick's best find:** Ring of Protection in a gizzard. Changed my whole month. Paid for new knives and had gold left over.

**Caution:**
- Gizzard contents are acidic (pH 2-3) - rinse everything!
- Some items may be cursed - don't put on without Identify
- Humanoid remains = report to authorities

**Typical haul:** 5-20 gp in miscellaneous findings per owlbear. Occasionally a windfall.

### Field Dressing Checklist (Hunter's Responsibility)

**Critical Timeframe:** Complete within 2 hours of death

☐ **Within 15 minutes:**
- Bleed it (cut throat or major artery)
- Hang by back legs if possible
- Allow 20-30 minutes for drainage

☐ **Within 30 minutes:**
- Get magical organs out (heart, liver, eyes, gall bladder)
- Preserve in alcohol, salt brine, or ice immediately

☐ **Within 1 hour (BEFORE cutting hindquarters):**
- Find and remove the musk gland
- Mark location with chalk
- Excise in 3-inch radius
- Discard safely away from processing area

☐ **Within 2 hours:**
- Gut it (remove stomach, intestines)
- Careful incision from sternum to pelvis
- Avoid puncturing intestines
- Check gizzard for treasure!

☐ **Within 4 hours (critical in hot weather):**
- Get carcass below 40°F
- Use ice, cold water (Create Water spell + ice), or cold cellar

**Transport weight:** 1,420 lbs dressed (requires wagon or 3-4 pack horses)

**Recommendation:** Hire a professional for field dressing if unsure. It's worth 35 gold to not ruin 150 gold of meat.

---

## Emergency Preservation - Jerky

**If you can't sell meat in 3 days**, turn it into jerky:

**Process:**
1. Slice meat into ¼-inch thick strips (cut against grain)
2. Salt cure: Coat generously, let sit 12-24 hours
3. Rinse thoroughly, pat dry
4. Smoke at 150°F for 8-12 hours OR air-dry in sun 2-3 days

**Yield loss:** 60-65% weight reduction (water evaporates)
- 575 lbs raw → ~215 lbs jerky

**Value:** 5 sp per pound = ~107 gp total

**Shelf life:** 1 year (dry environment, 50°F or below)

**Texture:** Tough and chewy. Soften by soaking in water or wine 30 minutes before eating.

## Final Notes from Garrick Ironknife, Master Butcher

**The Tenderloin Tradition:**
Every butcher keeps the tenderloin. This isn't greed - it's tradition. You did the skilled work. It's the best cut on the whole animal. It's a mark of respect for the craft. Take it home, cook it for your family, and remember why you do this job.

If someone insists you sell it, charge 30 gp per roast (premium over standard price) and tell them it's not for sale. Anyone who doesn't respect the tenderloin tradition isn't someone you want as a customer.

**The Bottom Line:**
That's better than a month's worth of cows, and about 40 times more profitable than deer. The only catch is that owlbears try to kill you before you kill them. But that's the adventurers' problem, not yours.

May your blades stay sharp and your cellars stay cold.
