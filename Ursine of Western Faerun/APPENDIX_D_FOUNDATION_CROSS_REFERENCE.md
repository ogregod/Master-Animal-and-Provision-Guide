---

**Topic:** Seasonal Body Condition

**Master Butcher's Guide Section:** § Animal Classification & Anatomy, Seasonal Variation in Game Animals

**What's Covered:**
- Fall fattening cycles (pre-hibernation, 9-10% body fat)

## II. MASTER PROVISIONER'S GUIDE REFERENCES

### § Herbs & Spices

**Topic:** Curing Salts

**Master Provisioner's Guide Section:** § Herbs & Spices, Curing Salts

**What's Covered:**
- **Prague Powder #1** (sodium nitrite, for smoking/curing, prevents botulism)
- **Prague Powder #2** (sodium nitrite + nitrate, for dry-cured hams, long-term)
- Ratios: 0.25% of meat weight (critical - too much is toxic, too little allows spoilage)
- Where to buy (apothecaries, alchemists, specialty provisioners)
- Cost: 3-5 sp per pound

**Referenced In Ursine Guide:**
- [APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md](APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md) - Exact cure formulas with Prague Powder #1 ratios
- Brine recipes (wet cure method)
- Dry cure recipes (ham, shoulder, backstrap)

**Why This Matters:** Prague Powder #1 prevents botulism (deadly food poisoning) in smoked meats. NEVER skip this ingredient for safety.

---

**Topic:** Salt Ratios

**Master Provisioner's Guide Section:** § Herbs & Spices, Salt in Preservation

**What's Covered:**
- Curing salt concentration: 2.5-3% of meat weight
- Brine strength (10-15% salt solution)
- Equilibrium curing (precise salt control)
- Oversalting risks (inedible, too salty)
- Undersalting risks (spoilage, unsafe)

**Referenced In Ursine Guide:**
- [APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md](APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md) - All cure formulas show exact salt percentages
- Pelt salt curing (25-40 lbs salt per large bear hide)

**Why This Matters:** Correct salt ratios ensure safe preservation without ruining flavor.

---

**Topic:** Jerky Seasonings

**Master Provisioner's Guide Section:** § Herbs & Spices, Meat Seasonings

**What's Covered:**
- Black pepper (traditional)
- Garlic powder (savory depth)
- Onion powder (umami)
- Paprika/smoked paprika (color, smoke flavor)
- Cayenne (heat)
- Cumin, coriander (exotic spice blends)

**Referenced In Ursine Guide:**
- [APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md](APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md) - Three jerky marinade recipes (Basic, Spiced, Sweet & Smoky)

**Why This Matters:** Quality seasonings increase jerky value by 20-30% (6 sp/lb → 8 sp/lb for spiced jerky).

---

### § Salt Varieties

**Topic:** Curing Salt vs Cooking Salt

**Master Provisioner's Guide Section:** § Salt Varieties, Types and Uses

**What's Covered:**
- **Kosher salt:** Large flakes, slow dissolve (best for dry curing)
- **Sea salt:** Natural minerals, complex flavor (premium brines)
- **Rock salt:** Cheap, bulk (pelt curing, not food)
- **Iodized salt:** Modern (avoid for curing, affects flavor)

**Referenced In Ursine Guide:**
- [APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md](APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md) - Salt selection for curing vs pelt preservation

**Why This Matters:** Using rock salt for meat curing results in off-flavors. Using expensive sea salt for pelt curing wastes money.

---

**Topic:** Pelt Preservation Salt

**Master Provisioner's Guide Section:** § Salt Varieties, Industrial & Preservation Uses

**What's Covered:**
- Coarse salt requirements (large crystals, better moisture absorption)
- Volume needed (15-40 lbs per bear pelt)
- Cost: 1-2 sp per 10 lbs (bulk pricing)
- Re-salting (when to replace salt during curing)

**Referenced In Ursine Guide:**
- [APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md](APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md) - Pelt salt curing process (25-40 lbs salt requirement)
- All breed files (pelt preservation costs in economic analysis)

**Why This Matters:** Skimping on salt (using 10 lbs instead of 25 lbs) results in pelt spoilage, losing 20-120 gp value.

---

### § Wood & Fuel

**Topic:** Smoking Woods

**Master Provisioner's Guide Section:** § Wood & Fuel, Smoking Woods

**What's Covered:**
- **Hickory:** Strong, bacon-like (best for pork, bear, game)

- **Oak:** Neutral, long-burn (best for large cuts, long smokes)
- **Maple:** Sweet, medium (versatile)
- **Cherry:** Sweet, mahogany color (premium presentation)
- **Mesquite:** Very strong, southwestern (use sparingly)
- **Alder:** Light, delicate (seafood, salmon-fed bear)

**Referenced In Ursine Guide:**
- [APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md](APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md) - Complete wood pairing guide by bear breed
- Coastal bear → Alder (complements salmon-fed flavor)
- Grizzly → Mesquite (strong meat, strong smoke)

**Why This Matters:** Wrong wood can overpower or underwhelm bear meat flavor. Proper pairing increases smoked meat value by 15-25%.

---

**Topic:** Wood Availability by Region

**Master Provisioner's Guide Section:** § Wood & Fuel, Regional Wood Sources

**What's Covered:**
- Northern regions (birch, pine, spruce - use sparingly, resinous)

- Urban (purchase smoking wood chunks, 4-8 sp per bag)

**Referenced In Ursine Guide:**
- [APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md](APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md) - Regional smoking variations
- Icewind Dale (birch, alder - local availability)
- Moonshae (oak, driftwood - coastal tradition)

**Why This Matters:** Regional wood availability affects smoking costs. Urban smoking requires purchased wood (4-8 sp), frontier uses free local wood.

---

### § Storage & Containers

- Seal methods (tight lids, wax sealing)

**Referenced In Ursine Guide:**
- [APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md](APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md) - Bear grease storage section (shelf life, rancidity prevention)
- All breed files (byproducts - rendered grease storage)

**Referenced In Ursine Guide:**
- [APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md](APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md) - Smoked bear meat storage (2-4 months shelf life)

**Why This Matters:** Proper packaging prevents smoked meat from drying out or developing off-flavors.

---

**Topic:** Jerky Packaging

**Master Provisioner's Guide Section:** § Storage & Containers, Dried Goods Packaging

**What's Covered:**
- Waxed cloth bundles (traditional, 4-8 oz portions)

- Sealed ceramic jars (long-term storage)
- Avoid airtight (can trap residual moisture, mold risk)

**Referenced In Ursine Guide:**
- [APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md](APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md) - Jerky packaging section
- [APPENDIX_B_CUTS_AND_PRICES.md](APPENDIX_B_CUTS_AND_PRICES.md) - Jerky bundle sizes (4 oz, 8 oz, 1 lb)

**Referenced In Ursine Guide:**
- [APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md](APPENDIX_C_BEAR_FAT_AND_PRESERVATION.md) - Frontier smoking variations (practical style)
- Northern preservation techniques (Icewind Dale - salt from sea, freeze-drying)

**Why This Matters:** Frontier hunters can't buy Prague Powder or specialty woods. Guides must adapt preservation to available resources.

## CONCLUSION

This cross-reference index provides complete integration between the Ursine of Western Faerûn guide and the foundational Master Butcher's Guide and Master Provisioner's Guide.

**How to Use This Index:**

1. **By Topic:** Need to know about smoking? Look up "Smoking & Curing" in Section III for all related references
2. **By Source:** Want to see what Master Provisioner's Guide sections are relevant? See Section II
3. **By File:** Need to know what a specific breed file references? See Section IV

**Total Cross-References:** 60+ specific section references across both foundation guides

**Integration Depth:** Every major topic in the Ursine guide references 2-5 foundation guide sections for deeper learning

---

**This comprehensive integration ensures the Ursine guide is not a standalone document, but a fully integrated component of the complete Master Animal and Provision Guide system.**
