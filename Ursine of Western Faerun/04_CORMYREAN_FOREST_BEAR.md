**PRIMARY ROLE:** Trophy hunting, noble prestige, luxury meat

**UNIQUE FEATURE:** Royal hunting exclusivity + premium acorn/berry marbling + trophy prestige

---

## BREED OVERVIEW & IMPORTANCE

The Cormyrean forest bear is **not about economics - it's about prestige**. You don't hunt these bears for profit. You hunt them because you have noble connections, royal favor, or Purple Dragon military service. The license costs 50-200 gold pieces. The bear is worth maybe 120 gold processed. But hanging that mounted Cormyrean bear head in your estate hall? **Priceless**. It says "I have royal connections. I hunt in the King's Forest. I am somebody."

**Why This Breed Matters:**
- **Royal Exclusivity:** Hunting licenses 50-200 gp (noble/military/guild only)
- **Premium Marbling:** Acorn/berry diet = exceptional meat quality
- **Trophy Culture:** Mounted displays, noble estates, social status
- **Purple Dragon Traditions:** Military hunting privileges, service rewards
- **Luxury Market:** Cormyrean nobility pay extreme premium (meat 150-200% over standard)
- **Perfect Condition:** Protected preserves = healthy, well-fed bears (no disease, optimal quality)

**Market Position:**
- **Suzail (Cormyr):** Only legal market (50-70 gp, noble buyers, trophy preparators)
- **Illegal Markets:** Poaching = 500 gp fine + prison (Purple Dragons enforce strictly)
- **Trophy Preparators:** 300-500 gp for full mounted bear (head, claws, pelt)

**Processing Reality Check:**
- **License Required:** 50-200 gp (connections required, not just money)
- **Legal Risk:** Poaching = serious crime (Purple Dragons patrol King's Forest)
- **Total Revenue:** 120-180 gp processed (premium meat + trophy)
- **Net After License:** -80 gp to +130 gp (if you're lucky)
- **Reality:** Hunt for prestige, not profit

**Professional Perspective:**
*"I've processed three Cormyrean bears in 132 years. All three were Purple Dragon veterans who earned licenses through service. None hunted for profit. They wanted the trophy, the story, the status. And they got it."*
**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## ECONOMIC ANALYSIS - THE PRESTIGE TAX

### Cost-Benefit: Is It Worth It?

**Cormyrean Bear Hunt:**
- License: 50-200 gp (huge range based on connections)
- Processing: 105 sp (10.5 gp)
- Trophy mount (optional): 300-500 gp
- **Total Costs:** 60.5-210.5 gp (without mount), 360.5-710.5 gp (with mount)

**Revenue:**
- Meat/byproducts: 77-95.8 gp
- **OR Trophy mount display:** Intangible (prestige, status, social capital)

**Scenario A: Sell Everything (No Trophy)**
- Revenue: 95.8 gp
- Cost: 60.5-210.5 gp
- **Net: -114.7 gp to +35.3 gp** (LOSS unless cheap license)

**Scenario B: Commission Trophy Mount (Keep for Estate)**
- Cost: 360.5-710.5 gp (license + mount)
- Revenue from selling meat: 77-95.8 gp
- Net cash: -282.7 gp to -614.7 gp (MAJOR LOSS)
- **But:** Trophy value = social prestige (can't be quantified in gold)

**Verdict:** You hunt Cormyrean bears for status, not money.

## PROFESSIONAL NOTES

### From Thadius Del Irontet

**"Pristine Bears Process Differently"**

*"Cormyrean bears are the healthiest I've ever processed. No parasites, no disease, no injuries, perfect coat.*

*Wild bears: You check for problems. Cormyrean bears: You check for perfection.*

*That's what 200 gold in royal forest management buys - pristine game."*

---

**"Don't Hunt for Profit"**

*"I've processed three Cormyrean bears. Every single hunter lost money on the hunt itself.*

*But they didn't care. They wanted the story. The trophy. The prestige.*

*If you're hunting to make money, hunt black bears. If you're hunting for glory, hunt royal game."*

---

### From Helena Fairstock

**"License Economics Are Designed to Exclude"**

*"50-200 gold for a license. That's intentional. Crown wants nobles and veterans, not commercial hunters.*

*Result: Limited hunting pressure, healthy population, exclusivity = prestige.*

*It's not about revenue (Crown could charge 20 gp and sell 200 licenses). It's about control."*

---

**"Trophy Mount ROI Is Social Capital"**

*"500 gold for a mounted Cormyrean bear head. Sounds insane.*

*But: Hang it in your estate hall. Invite Cormyrean nobles. Discuss your royal hunt. Make connections.*

*One business deal worth 1,000+ gold from those connections. Trophy paid for itself.*

*That's how nobility thinks. Gold buys gold."*

---

**Cormyrean forest bears are prestige hunting, not profit hunting. You pay 50-200 gp for exclusivity, hunt in royal preserves, and commission 300-500 gp trophy mounts to display social status. The meat is exceptional quality (acorn-marbled, pristine condition), but that's secondary to the prestige value. Hunt these if you have noble connections, military service, or want to demonstrate wealth and status. Skip them if you're hunting for economic profit.**

**— Thadius Del Irontet & Helena Fairstock**
