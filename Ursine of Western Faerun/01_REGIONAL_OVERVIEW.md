- **Unique flavor:** Salmon-fed meat (sweet, rich, premium pricing +20%)
- **Water-resistant pelt:** Valuable to sailors, fishermen (specialty market)
- **Northlander culture:** Fishing bear traditions, island festivals (hunting during festivals = cultural offense)

---

### CORMYR (Royal Forest Preserves)

**Primary Species: Cormyrean Forest Bear**
- **Range:** King's Forest, Hullack Forest (Cormyr only)
- **Population:** Very Rare (protected royal game, noble hunting rights)
- **Hunting Access:** **RESTRICTED** - Royal hunting licenses only (50-200 gp, noble connections required)
- **Market:** Suzail (royal court, nobility), extremely limited supply
- **Typical Size:** 400-550 lbs (male), 280-380 lbs (female)

**Hunting Notes:**
- **Legal requirements:** Royal license mandatory (Purple Dragons enforce strictly)
- **Poaching penalties:** 500 gp fine + prison time (Cormyr takes forest law seriously)
- **Trophy culture:** Noble hunting parties, mounted displays, social status
- **Premium meat:** Acorn/berry diet, exceptional marbling, luxury market
- **Trophy value:** Claws, teeth, skull (15-30 gp) - status symbols

1. Noble sponsorship (connection to Cormyrean noble house)
2. Guild reputation (Master Butcher/Hunter certification)
3. Purple Dragon service (military/quest reward)
4. Purchase (50-200 gp + 1d4 weeks processing time)

**Economic Reality:**
- Gross value: 120-180 gp (premium meat + trophy + pelt)
- License cost: 50-200 gp
- Net profit: -80 gp to +130 gp (if you can even get license)

**Verdict:** Prestige > profit. Nobles hunt these for status, not economics.

---

### CHULT (Southern Jungles) **IMPORT ONLY**

**Primary Species: Chultan Sun Bear**
- **Range:** Chult jungles (Port Nyanzaru region)
- **Population:** Legendary (extremely rare in Western Faerûn - import only)

- Alchemists import for gallbladder only (discard meat/pelt)
- Exotic collectors (live bears for menageries)
- Chultan merchants bring as exotic goods (cultural mystique)
- Wizard component sourcing (rare ingredients)

## TRANSPORT & LOGISTICS

### Field to Market: Getting Bears to Buyers

**Fresh Meat Transport (Perishable - 3-7 days):**

**Short Distance (< 50 miles):**
- Cart/wagon: 5-10 sp/day rental
- Pack animals: 2-3 sp/day rental (50 lbs per animal)
- Time: 1-3 days
- **Feasible for:** Sword Coast (forests to Waterdeep/Daggerford)

**Medium Distance (50-150 miles):**
- Wagon + ice: 15-25 sp/day (if ice available)
- Fast courier: 50-80 sp (rush delivery, 2-3 days)
- Time: 4-7 days (spoilage risk without preservation)
- **Feasible for:** Moonshae to Waterdeep (ship), mountains to Mirabar

**Long Distance (150+ miles):**
- **NOT FEASIBLE for fresh meat** (will spoil)
- Must preserve first (smoking, curing, jerky)
- **Example:** Icewind Dale to Waterdeep (600+ miles, 20-30 days travel)

**Preserved Meat Transport (Shelf-Stable - months):**

**Any Distance:**
- Smoked bear: 6-12 months shelf life
- Bear jerky: 6-12 months shelf life
- Rendered bear grease (sealed crocks): 6-12 months

**Transport Costs:**
- Crated goods: 1-2 sp per 10 lbs per 100 miles
- Barrel/crock goods: 2-3 sp per container per 100 miles
- **Example:** 50 lbs smoked bear, Icewind Dale to Waterdeep = 30-40 sp freight

**Pelt Transport:**
- Salt-cured pelts: Stable (no spoilage)
- Rolled/bundled: 5-10 lbs per pelt (except polar bear 15-20 lbs)
- Cost: 1-2 sp per pelt per 100 miles
- **Example:** Polar bear pelt, Icewind Dale to Waterdeep = 12-15 sp freight

### Processing Locations

**Field Processing (Wilderness):**
- **Advantages:** Immediate (prevent spoilage), reduce weight (leave bones/waste)
- **Disadvantages:** No tools/equipment, weather exposure, scavenger risk
- **Best for:** Remote hunts (mountains, deep forest), large bears (transport whole impractical)

**Town/Settlement Processing:**
- **Advantages:** Proper tools, controlled environment, expert help available
- **Disadvantages:** Transport whole carcass, butcher fees (if hiring), time delay
- **Best for:** Near settlements, small-medium bears, quality pelt priority

**When to Process in Field:**
1. More than 1 day travel to settlement
2. Bear > 500 lbs (too heavy to transport whole)
3. Hot weather (spoilage risk in hours)
4. Party has Survival expertise (confident in field dressing)

**When to Transport Whole:**
1. Within 6-12 hours of settlement
2. Bear < 300 lbs (manageable weight)
3. Cold weather (natural refrigeration)
4. Premium pelt (want professional tanner)

## PROFESSIONAL ADVICE FROM HELENA

*"New to bear hunting? Start with Sword Coast black bears in Neverwinter Wood. They're common, legal, and you can sell the whole carcass to a Waterdeep butcher for 15-20 gp with zero processing. Learn the basics before heading to Icewind Dale for polar bears."*

*"Polar bear pelts are worth 100 gp in Waterdeep, but transport from Icewind Dale costs 40 gp and three months. Most hunters calculate profit before the hunt, not after they're stuck with a frozen pelt in Luskan. Do the math first."*

*"Cormyrean royal hunting licenses cost 50-200 gp. The bear you hunt is worth maybe 120 gp processed. You're paying for prestige and noble connections, not profit. Know what you're buying."*

**This regional overview provides the foundation for informed bear hunting decisions. Location matters as much as processing skill.**
