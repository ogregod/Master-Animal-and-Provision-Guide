## ABOUT THIS GUIDE

This is a professional reference for processing bears of Western Faerûn. Whether you're a frontier butcher handling wild-caught black bears or an urban provisioner sourcing premium polar bear pelts, this guide provides the technical knowledge you need.

**What This Guide Covers:**
- **8 Natural Bear Breeds** - From common Sword Coast black bears to rare Chultan sun bears
- **Complete Processing Techniques** - Field dressing to retail fabrication
- **Bear Fat Rendering** - Premium bear grease production and applications
- **Preservation Mastery** - Smoking, curing, jerky production, pelt preservation
- **Alchemical Components** - Gallbladder harvesting and market values
- **Economics** - Fresh vs preserved value analysis, trophy markets
- **Seasonal Hunting** - Fall season timing, population management
- **Trophy Processing** - Pelts, claws, skulls, mounted displays

**What Makes Bears Unique:**
- **Fat Rendering:** Bear grease is premium product worth 4-6 sp/lb (often 40-50% of total revenue)
- **Seasonal Variation:** Fall bears are obese (10% body fat), spring bears are lean (4-5% body fat)
- **Trophy Value:** Premium pelts (polar bear white fur = 80-120 gp) often exceed meat value
- **Alchemical Value:** Gallbladders highly valued by alchemists (2 sp to 40 gp depending on species)
- **Omnivore Meat:** Diet impacts flavor - salmon-fed coastal bears taste different from acorn-fed forest bears
- **Wild Game:** Most bears are hunted, not farmed (field dressing and wilderness preservation critical)

### For Players

**Should We Process This Bear Ourselves?**

**Simple Answer:** If you killed it and have 12-20 hours, yes - it's profitable.

**Quick Economics (300 lb Black Bear):**
- Sell whole to butcher: 15-20 gp
- Process yourself (basic): 27-32 gp profit (12 hours labor)
- Process + preserve: 42-50 gp profit (34 hours labor)

**What You Need:**
- **Skills:** Survival +3 or higher for field dressing
- **Tools:** Hunting knife, skinning knife, rope, salt (5 gp basic kit)
- **Time:** 2-3 hours field dressing, 10-18 hours full processing
- **Preservation:** Smokehouse access or 10+ lbs salt for curing

**When to Just Sell the Whole Carcass:**
- In town (butcher available, no processing space)
- Time-critical quest (can't spare 12+ hours)
- Low Survival skill (risk spoilage, botched skinning)
- Small bear (< 150 lbs = marginal profit after labor)

**When Processing Is Worth It:**
- Large bear (500+ lbs = significant profit)
- Premium pelt (polar bear, perfect condition = 80-120 gp)
- Party has Survival expertise (efficient processing, no spoilage risk)
- Downtime available (between quests, winter camp)
- Smokehouse access (preserved meat = +50% profit)

## SEASONAL HUNTING CALENDAR

### Fall Hunting Season (September - November) **PEAK SEASON**

**Why Fall Is Best:**
- Bears are obese (pre-hibernation fattening)
- Maximum fat yield: 8-10% body weight (vs 4-5% spring)
- Prime pelts: Full winter coat growing in
- Meat quality: Excellent (well-fed, not stressed)
- Weather: Cool (prevents spoilage during field dressing)

**Typical Bear Condition (Fall):**
- 300 lb black bear: 25 lbs rendered fat, premium pelt
- 800 lb polar bear: 80 lbs rendered fat, thick white coat

**Professional Timing:**
- Early Fall (Sept): Good meat, pelt not yet prime
- Mid Fall (Oct): **OPTIMAL** - best balance meat/fat/pelt
- Late Fall (Nov): Prime pelts, bears entering dens (harder to find)

### Winter (December - February) **DENNING SEASON - DO NOT HUNT**

**Professional Standards:**
- Bears are hibernating (easy kills = unethical, illegal in most regions)
- Pregnant females give birth in dens (population damage)
- Meat quality poor (living off fat reserves, muscle catabolism)
- Guild ethics: Winter bear hunting = professional censure

**Exception:** Problem bears (active in winter, raiding settlements) may be taken by licensed hunters only.

### Spring (March - May) **LEAN SEASON - AVOID**

**Why Spring Is Poor:**
- Bears are emaciated (used fat reserves during hibernation)
- Minimal fat yield: 4-5% body weight (60% reduction vs fall)
- Poor pelts: Shedding winter coat, patchy, thin
- Meat quality: Acceptable but lean (less flavor, less value)
- Mothers with cubs (ethical/legal restrictions)

**Exception:** Early spring (March) for specialty lean jerky (some hunters prefer lean meat for drying).

### Summer (June - August) **OFF-SEASON**

**Why Summer Is Difficult:**
- Bears are active, wary, harder to hunt
- Heat = rapid spoilage (field dressing must be perfect, immediate)
- Pelts are thin (summer coat, minimal value)
- Fat yield: Moderate (rebuilding from spring, not yet fall obese)
- Insects: Flies, maggots (meat spoilage risk extreme)

**When Summer Hunting Happens:**
- Problem bears (crop raiding, livestock kills)
- Opportunistic hunting (party encounters bear during travel)
- Coastal bears (salmon runs = good condition)

## PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS

### Hunting Ethics

**Sustainable Population Management:**
- Take mature males preferentially (minimal population impact)
- Avoid females with cubs (illegal in most regions, Guild violation)
- Respect denning season (winter hunting = unethical)
- Report problem bears to authorities (don't hunt without license)

**Clean Kills:**
- Use appropriate weapons (CR-appropriate party strength)
- Minimize animal suffering (quick death preferred)
- Don't wound and lose bears (tracking responsibility)

**Wilderness Respect:**
- Pack out all waste (entrails, unusable parts)
- Don't pollute water sources
- Respect tribal hunting grounds (seek permission)
- Follow regional hunting laws

### Processing Standards

**Field Dressing (Wilderness):**
- Process within 2-4 hours of kill (prevent spoilage)
- Hang carcass for cooling (ventilation, prevent bacteria)
- Protect from scavengers and insects
- Keep meat clean (dirt/hair contamination ruins value)

**Retail Fabrication (Workshop):**
- Sharp knives (dull blades = ragged cuts, lower value)
- Cold environment (40°F or below prevents bacterial growth)
- Sanitation (clean workspace, wash hands, prevent cross-contamination)
- Trim consistently (uniform portions sell better)

**Preservation:**
- Accurate cure measurements (Prague Powder #1 - too much = toxic, too little = spoilage)
- Temperature control (smoking at wrong temp = food poisoning risk)
- Proper storage (sealed containers, cool/dark conditions)
- Labeling (date processed, contents, preservation method)

### Safety Protocols

**Bear Hunting Safety:**
- Never hunt alone (bears are dangerous, injuries happen)
- Carry healing potions (mauling risk - especially grizzlies)
- Know when to retreat (wounded bear = extreme danger)
- Watch for cubs (mother bears are hyper-aggressive)

**Processing Safety:**
- Sharp knife safety (cut away from body, secure grip)
- Heavy lifting (bear quarters are 50-150 lbs - use helpers)
- Bone saw safety (stable work surface, controlled cuts)
- First aid kit available (cuts and injuries common)

**Disease Recognition:**
- Examine liver, lungs, intestines (discoloration/lesions = disease)
- Abnormal smell = spoilage or infection (discard immediately)
- Parasites visible = thorough cooking required (or discard)
- When in doubt, don't process (human health > profit)

**Know Your Limits:**
- First bear? Hire experienced hunter/butcher (learn before solo)
- Large bear (700+ lbs)? Requires 2-3 people (don't attempt alone)
- Premium pelt? Hire professional tanner (don't ruin 100 gp pelt learning)
- Uncertain about disease? Consult guild butcher or healer (don't risk it)
