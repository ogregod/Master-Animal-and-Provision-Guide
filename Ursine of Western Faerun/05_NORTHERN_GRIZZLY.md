# NORTHERN GRIZZLY
## *Ursus arctos horribilis* - The Apex Trophy

**ORIGIN:** Spine of the World, Nether Mountains, deep northern wilderness
**PRIMARY ROLE:** Dangerous game trophy hunting, adventurer challenge, extreme meat/fat yields
**MARKET POSITION:** Trophy market (pelt/claws), dangerous game prestige, veteran hunters
**PROCESSING DIFFICULTY:** Very Hard (CR 2 danger, massive size 950 lbs, remote location)
**UNIQUE FEATURE:** CR 2 combat (requires party), largest bear, highest trophy value (160-270 gp)

---

## BREED OVERVIEW & IMPORTANCE

The Northern grizzly is **the ultimate bear**. 950 pounds of apex predator. CR 2 - can kill a 2nd level fighter in two rounds if it gets lucky. Requires a 3-5 person party minimum, preferably level 3+. This isn't butchering, it's big-game hunting. You don't hunt grizzlies for profit (though 200-300 gp total value is significant). You hunt them for **glory**. For the trophy. For the story. For the grizzly pelt cloak that says "I killed the apex predator of Western Faerûn."

**Why This Breed Matters:**
- **Dangerous Game:** CR 2 (450 XP), multiattack (bite +5, two claws +5), HP 42
- **Largest Bear:** 700-1,200 lbs (950 lbs average = **217% heavier than black bear**)
- **Highest Trophy Value:** Perfect pelt 100-150 gp, claw set 40-80 gp, skull 20-40 gp (total 160-270 gp in trophies alone)
- **Extreme Yields:** 330 lbs retail cuts, 85 lbs bear grease, massive byproducts
- **Adventurer Prestige:** Grizzly cloak = proven warrior status (Northern tribes, adventurer culture)
- **Northern Tribal Rites:** Coming-of-age hunts (Uthgardt, Reghed traditions)

**Market Position:**
- **Trophy Markets:** Neverwinter, Luskan, Mirabar (100-250 gp mounted trophies)
- **Adventurer Gear:** Grizzly cloak (150-300 gp, status symbol)
- **Meat Markets:** Waterdeep, Neverwinter (bulk bear meat, premium size)

**Processing Reality Check:**
- **Party Required:** 3-5 members minimum (CR 2 deadly for solo/duo)
- **Remote Location:** 5-10 days deep wilderness (Spine of the World, Nether Mountains)
- **Processing Time:** 16-20 hours (massive size, heavy work)
- **Transport:** Wagon required (330 lbs meat + 100 lb pelt = 400+ lbs cargo)
- **Total Revenue:** 200-300 gp (trophy + meat + fat + claws)
- **Net Profit (5-person party):** 30-50 gp per person (after costs, divided among party)

**Professional Perspective:**
*"I've processed seven grizzlies in 132 years. Every single one was killed by an adventuring party, not a solo hunter. CR 2 isn't a suggestion - it's a warning. You need backup. And healing. And luck."*
**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## PROCESSING SPECIFICATIONS

### Yield Data (950 lb Grizzly - Standard Male, Fall)

**Live to Dressed:**
```
Live Weight: 950 lbs (**LARGEST BEAR**)
× 75% Dressing = 712.5 lbs dressed carcass
```

**Dressed to Retail:**
```
Dressed Weight: 712.5 lbs
× 46% Retail = 327.75 lbs retail cuts
(Lower % due to massive bones, heavy connective tissue)

Breakdown:
- Retail cuts: 327.75 lbs (46% of dressed)
- Bones: 142 lbs (20% of dressed) - **massive, heavy**
- Fat trim: 85.5 lbs (12% of dressed) - **enormous yield**
- Trim/waste: 157.25 lbs (22% of dressed)
```

**Live to Retail:**
```
950 lbs live → 327.75 lbs retail = 34.5% total yield

(Lowest % of any bear - massive size = more bone/waste proportion)
```

## ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

### Cost-Benefit: Is Grizzly Hunting Worth It?

**Party of 5, 12-Day Expedition:**

**Costs:**
- **Expedition supplies:** 15-25 gp (food, camping, healing potions for 5 people × 12 days)
- **Guide (optional):** 50-100 gp (experienced wilderness guide, 10 gp/day × 10 days)
- **Processing labor:** 30 gp (hire professional, divide labor)
- **Transport (wagon + horses):** 40-60 gp (return trip to market)
- **Professional trophy tanning:** 50 gp (required for premium pelt)
- **TOTAL COSTS:** 185-265 gp

**Revenue (Sell Everything, No Mount):**
- Total value: 179.5-216.7 gp
- **NET PROFIT:** -85.5 gp to +31.7 gp (BREAK-EVEN TO LOSS if all costs incurred)

**DIVIDED AMONG 5 PARTY MEMBERS:** -17 gp to +6 gp per person

**Wait - Why Hunt Then?**

**Reality Check:**
1. **Keep Trophy Items** (pelt, claws) = personal prestige value (can't quantify in gold)
2. **Sell Meat/Fat Only** = 125-138 gp revenue, -140 gp costs, net -15 gp total = each member pays 3 gp for grizzly trophy experience
3. **Commission Full Mount** (300-500 gp commissioned) = lose money hunting, gain status symbol worth more socially
4. **Adventuring Party Already in Area** (quest, other business) = zero expedition cost, pure profit
5. **Tribal Rite of Passage** (Uthgardt coming-of-age) = not about profit, about cultural tradition

**Verdict:** You don't hunt grizzlies for gold - you hunt them for glory, prestige, and the story.

---

## CULTURAL NOTES

### Northern Tribal Rites of Passage

**Uthgardt Tribes:**
- Young warriors hunt grizzly as coming-of-age trial
- Solo hunts (extreme danger, but proves warrior status)
- Successful hunt = tribal recognition, adult status
- Grizzly claw necklace = warrior symbol

**Reghed Tribes (Icewind Dale):**
- Grizzly hunts less common (polar bears more available)
- But still respected (dangerous game = prestige)
- Grizzly cloak = exotic trophy (traded from southern tribes)

### Adventurer Prestige Culture

**Grizzly Pelt Cloak:**
- Wearing grizzly pelt = "I killed CR 2 solo or with party"
- Status symbol (taverns, adventurer guilds)
- Conversation starter ("How did you kill it? Tell the story.")
- Practical (warm, durable, intimidating)

**Trophy Displays:**
- Mounted grizzly head in adventurer's home/tavern
- Proof of dangerous game experience
- Attracts quests (dangerous missions seek proven fighters)

**Claw Jewelry:**
- Grizzly claw necklace/bracelet = adventurer badge
- "I've faced apex predators and survived"
- Some enchant claws (magic items, +1 amulets)

## PROFESSIONAL NOTES

### From Thadius Del Irontet

**"Don't Hunt Alone - Ever"**

*"Seven grizzlies processed in 132 years. Every single one killed by a party. Not one solo hunter.*

*Why? Because solo hunters who try don't come back. CR 2 can one-shot a level 2 character with lucky crits.*

*Minimum three people. Five is better. Tank, healers, ranged DPS. Tactics, not bravery."*

---

**"Largest, Hardest, Most Valuable Bear"**

*"950-pound grizzly takes 60-70 hours to process fully. Black bear: 23-31 hours.*

*But: Total value 200-300 gold. Black bear: 36 gold.*

*Is it worth 30 extra hours? If you're selling trophies to nobles, yes. If you're selling meat to butchers, no."*

---

### From Helena Fairstock

**"Trophy Market Is Different Economics"**

*"Grizzly claw set: 60-80 gold. That's four black bears worth of claws.*

*Why? Rarity (maybe 10-20 grizzly hunts per year across all Western Faerûn), danger (CR 2), prestige.*

*Find noble buyers BEFORE hunting. Contract for trophy mount (400-500 gold commissioned). Then hunt. Don't hunt hoping to find buyers."*

---

**"Party Economics Change Everything"**

*"Solo hunter: Kill grizzly, process 60 hours, sell 200 gold, net 150 gold = 2.5 gp/hour.*

*Party of 5: Kill grizzly, process 60 hours (shared), sell 200 gold, divide 5 ways = 40 gold each for 12 hours work = 3.3 gp/hour.*

*Party is better gold-per-hour AND safer. Never solo hunt grizzlies."*

---

**Northern grizzlies are the apex bear - largest size (950 lbs), most dangerous (CR 2), highest trophy value (170-290 gp in trophies alone). Hunt with a party (3-5 members minimum), expect 12-day expeditions, and understand this is prestige hunting, not profit hunting. The grizzly pelt cloak and claw trophy necklace are worth more socially than the gold from selling them. Perfect for adventuring parties, Northern tribal rites, and dangerous game trophy collectors. Not for commercial hunters.**

**— Thadius Del Irontet & Helena Fairstock**
