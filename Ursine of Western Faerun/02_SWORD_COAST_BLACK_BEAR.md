# SWORD COAST BLACK BEAR
## *Ursus americanus faerûnensis* - The Baseline Standard

**ORIGIN:** Sword Coast temperate forests
**PRIMARY ROLE:** General purpose meat, moderate fat yield, standard processing baseline
**MARKET POSITION:** Most common bear, affordable, reliable availability
**PROCESSING DIFFICULTY:** Moderate (standard wild game)
**BASELINE STATUS:** All bear processing standards derive from this breed

---

## BREED OVERVIEW & IMPORTANCE

The Sword Coast black bear is **the baseline** for all bear processing in Western Faerûn. When butchers talk about "standard bear yields," "typical processing time," or "average bear grease production," they mean this breed. Every other bear in this guide is described as a variation: "Yields 2% more fat than standard," "Processing time +4 hours vs baseline," "25% larger than black bear."

**Why This Breed Matters:**
- **Most Accessible:** Found throughout Sword Coast forests, close to major settlements
- **Reliable Supply:** Stable population, predictable fall hunting season
- **Standard Economics:** Prices established, market saturation understood
- **Processing Baseline:** Learn on black bears before attempting polar bears or grizzlies
- **Economic Foundation:** Moderate investment, moderate profit, low risk

**Market Position:**
- **Frontier communities:** Primary bear meat source (Daggerford, Triboar, Phandalin)
- **Urban markets:** Common product (Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Baldur's Gate)
- **Budget option:** Less expensive than premium bears (Cormyrean, polar), more available than exotic

**Professional Perspective:**
*"Start with black bears. Common, manageable size, forgiving processing. Master the basics before you attempt an 800-pound polar bear in -40°F weather. The principles are the same, but mistakes on a grizzly cost more than mistakes on a black bear."*
**— Thadius Del Irontet, 132 years experience**

## SEASONAL AVAILABILITY

### Fall Hunting Season (Sept-Nov) **OPTIMAL**

**Early Fall (September):**
- **Condition:** Good (fattening, preparing for winter)
- **Weight:** 280-320 lbs average
- **Fat yield:** 7-9% body weight (20-28 lbs trim)
- **Pelt quality:** Fair (summer coat shedding, winter coat growing)
- **Market:** Low saturation (prices baseline or +10%)
- **Weather:** Comfortable (60-70°F days, cool nights, no spoilage risk)

**Mid Fall (October) - PEAK SEASON:**
- **Condition:** Excellent (obese, pre-hibernation)
- **Weight:** 300-350 lbs average
- **Fat yield:** 10% body weight (30-35 lbs trim) **MAXIMUM**
- **Pelt quality:** Good (winter coat 70% grown)
- **Market:** Moderate saturation (prices baseline)
- **Weather:** Optimal (40-60°F, cold storage natural)

**Late Fall (November):**
- **Condition:** Excellent (peak fat, entering dens)
- **Weight:** 320-350 lbs average
- **Fat yield:** 10% body weight (32-35 lbs trim)
- **Pelt quality:** Excellent (full winter coat, thick)
- **Market:** HIGH saturation (prices -20-30%, everyone hunting before winter)
- **Weather:** Cold (30-50°F, excellent preservation conditions)
- **Challenge:** Bears harder to find (entering dens, less active)

**Professional Timing:**
- **Best profit:** Early-mid October (peak condition, baseline prices, moderate competition)
- **Best pelt:** Late November (full winter coat, accept lower meat prices)
- **Best meat prices:** Early September (low supply, premium prices)

---

### Winter (Dec-Feb) - **CLOSED SEASON**

**DO NOT HUNT WINTER DENS**

**Professional Standards:**
- Bears are hibernating (easy kills = unethical)
- Pregnant females give birth in dens (Jan-Feb)
- Guild ethics: Winter bear hunting = professional censure
- Legal: Illegal in most Sword Coast settlements

**Exception:** Problem bears (active in winter, raiding settlements) - licensed removal only by authorities

---

### Spring (Mar-May) - **POOR SEASON**

**Post-Hibernation Condition:**
- **Weight:** 180-250 lbs (lost 20-30% body weight during hibernation)
- **Fat yield:** 4-5% (9-12 lbs trim) **65% REDUCTION vs fall**
- **Pelt quality:** Poor (shedding winter coat, patchy, thin)
- **Meat quality:** Acceptable but lean (less marbling, less flavor)
- **Mothers with cubs:** Illegal to hunt (population management)

**Limited Market:**
- Specialty lean jerky (some prefer lean meat for drying)
- Problem bear removal (livestock protection)
- **Most butchers avoid spring bears** (low profit, poor quality)

---

### Summer (Jun-Aug) - **OFF-SEASON**

**Summer Condition:**
- **Weight:** 220-280 lbs (rebuilding from spring)
- **Fat yield:** 6-7% (13-20 lbs trim)
- **Pelt quality:** Poor (thin summer coat, minimal value)
- **Meat quality:** Fair (improving, but not peak)

**Summer Challenges:**
- **Heat = rapid spoilage** (field dressing must be perfect, 2-4 hour window)
- **Insects:** Flies, maggots (extreme contamination risk)
- **Bear behavior:** Active, wary, harder to hunt
- **Market:** Off-season (limited demand)

**When Summer Hunting Happens:**
- Opportunistic (party encounters bear during travel)
- Problem bears (crop raiding, settlement protection)
- Desperate hunters (need income, accept lower quality/profit)

**Professional Advice:** Avoid summer bears unless necessary. Low profit, high spoilage risk, poor quality.

### **VALUE INSIGHTS**

**Byproducts dominate value:**
- Meat cuts total: 214.5 sp (59%)
- Byproducts total: 151 sp (41%)
- **Bear grease alone: 125 sp (34% of total value)**

**Never skip fat rendering:**
- Rendering labor: 8 hours @ 4 sp = 32 sp cost (if hired)
- Value gain: 125 sp (rendered) vs 45 sp (fresh fat) = +80 sp profit
- **Net: +48 sp profit for 8 hours work = 6 sp/hour** (50% better than journeyman wage)

**Steak vs roast total value:**
- Similar total value (354-366 sp range)
- Steaks sell faster (individual buyers)
- Roasts sell in larger chunks (family purchases, slower turnover)
- **Recommendation:** Mix both (backstrap steaks, rib roasts, ham steaks)

---

## PRESERVATION METHODS

### 1. SMOKING BEAR MEAT (Primary Method)

**Best Cuts for Smoking:**
- Ham roasts (large, fatty, traditional smoked ham)
- Shoulder roasts (tough cuts benefit from slow smoke)
- Ribs (excellent smoked, fall-off-bone)
- Backstrap (premium smoked loin, luxury item)

**Process Overview:**
1. **Dry Brine:** 2.5% salt, 2% sugar, 0.25% Prague Powder #1 (by weight)
2. **Cure Time:** 7-10 days (refrigerated or cool cellar 34-40°F)
3. **Rinse:** Remove excess cure
4. **Dry:** Air dry 2-4 hours (forms pellicle, smoke adhesion)
5. **Cold Smoke:** 60-90°F, 12-18 hours (preserves, adds flavor, not cooked)
6. **OR Hot Smoke:** 200-225°F, 4-6 hours (fully cooked, ready to eat)

**Recommended Woods:**
- **Hickory:** Strong, traditional (best for ham/shoulder)
- **Apple:** Sweet, mild (best for backstrap)
- **Oak:** Neutral, long smoke (good for ribs)

**Yields & Value:**
- Fresh ham roast: 4 lbs @ 2 sp/lb = 8 sp
- Smoked ham roast: 3 lbs @ 4-5 sp/lb = 12-15 sp (25% moisture loss, 50-90% value gain)

**Storage:**
- Cold smoked + dried: 2-4 months
- Hot smoked (fully cooked): 2-3 weeks (refrigerated) or 1-2 months (re-dried)
- Vacuum sealed: 6+ months

**Economics:**
- 12 lbs fresh roasts @ 2 sp/lb = 24 sp
- 9 lbs smoked roasts @ 4.5 sp/lb = 40.5 sp
- **Value increase: +69%** (16.5 sp gain)
- Labor: 2 hours prep + 12 hours smoking (mostly unattended) = 14 hours
- Supplies: 1 lb Prague Powder (5 sp), 2 lbs salt (1 sp), sugar (2 sp), wood (3 sp) = 11 sp
- **Net profit: +5.5 sp** (after labor/supplies)

**When Worth It:**
- Long-term storage needed (frontier, winter provisions)
- Premium market (smoked game = luxury)
- Smokehouse already available (amortized cost)

**When Not Worth It:**
- Fresh meat sells immediately (no storage need)
- Urban market with refrigeration
- Small quantities (setup cost > profit)

- Shoulder (trim fat first)
- Neck (tough but flavorful)

**Process Overview:**
1. **Slice:** 1/4 inch thick strips, **with the grain** (chewy texture)
2. **Marinade:** Salt (3%), pepper, optional spices (garlic, smoke, paprika) - 12-24 hours
3. **Dry:**
   - Air dry: 24-48 hours in cool, dry, ventilated area
   - Smoke-dry: 150°F with smoke, 6-10 hours (best flavor)
   - Dehydrator: 145-155°F, 6-8 hours
4. **Test:** Bend test (should crack but not break, slightly pliable)

**Yields & Value:**
- 10 lbs fresh lean meat @ 2 sp/lb = 20 sp
- 3-4 lbs jerky @ 6 sp/lb = 18-24 sp (65-70% moisture loss)
- **Weight advantage:** 10 lbs → 3 lbs (portability)

**Storage:** 6-12 months dry, cool storage (waxed cloth or sealed container)

**Uses:**
- Travel rations (lightweight, nutritious, 1 lb jerky = 2-3 days rations)
- Trail food (hunters, adventurers, caravans)
- Emergency provisions (long shelf life)

**Economics:**
- 10 lbs fresh meat = 20 sp
- 3.5 lbs jerky = 21 sp
- Labor: 4 hours (slicing, marinading, setup) + 8 hours drying (unattended) = 12 hours
- Supplies: Salt, spices (2-3 sp)
- **Net profit: -1 sp** (basically breakeven)

**Why Make Jerky Then?**
- **Not about profit, about utility:**
  - Portability (3 lbs vs 10 lbs)
  - Shelf life (months vs days)
  - No refrigeration needed
  - Premium product (specialty market)

**Market:**
- Adventuring parties (willing to pay premium for convenience)
- Caravan traders (long-distance travel)
- Frontier communities (winter provisions)

### 3. BEAR FAT RENDERING (Highest Value Preservation)

**Process:** (See Universal Ursine Cuts for full detail)

**Quick Summary:**
1. Collect all fat (30 lbs from 300 lb bear)
2. Cube into 1-inch pieces
3. Wet rendering: Simmer in water 6-8 hours at 180-200°F
4. Strain, cool, package in ceramic crocks

**Yields & Value:**
- 30 lbs fresh fat @ 1.5 sp/lb = 45 sp
- 25 lbs rendered grease @ 5 sp/lb = 125 sp
- 3 lbs cracklings @ 1 sp/lb = 3 sp
- **Total: 128 sp** (vs 45 sp fresh = +184% value increase)

**Labor & Supplies:**
- Labor: 8 hours (2 hours active prep, 6 hours unattended simmering)
- Supplies: Firewood (2 sp), crocks (5-8 sp for ceramic, reusable)
- **Net profit: +75-80 sp**

**Why This Is Critical:**
- Highest value-add of any preservation method
- Bear grease = 34% of total bear value
- **Skipping this = leaving 80 sp profit on the table**

**Market:**
- Universal (cooking, waterproofing, medicinal)
- Urban markets (Waterdeep bulk buyers)
- Frontier (essential product, high demand)

### 4. PELT PRESERVATION (Trophy/Trade)

**Process:**
1. **Skinning:** Careful removal (avoid cuts - reduces value)
2. **Fleshing:** Remove ALL fat/meat from skin side (prevents rot)
3. **Salt cure:** Heavy salt coating (5-10 lbs salt), 48-72 hours
4. **Dry:** Air dry in shade (prevents bacterial growth)

**Professional Tanning (Optional):**
- Brain tanning: Traditional (soft, supple) - 10-15 sp professional
- Chemical tanning: Commercial (durable) - 15-20 sp professional
- Adds 10-20 sp to final value (25 sp raw → 35-45 sp tanned)

**Value:**
- Raw salt-cured: 15-25 sp (transportable, stable)
- Professional tanned: 25-45 sp (finished product, ready for use)

**When to Tan Professionally:**
- Trophy mount (perfect pelt, pay for quality)
- Premium market (wealthy buyers expect finished product)
- Maximize value (tanning cost < value added)

**When to Sell Raw:**
- Standard pelt (buyer will tan themselves)
- Bulk trading (fur traders buy raw)
- Time-sensitive (immediate sale needed)

- Master Butcher's Guide § Processing Techniques, Hide Processing
- **Appendix C: Bear Fat & Preservation Mastery, Pelt Preservation** (detailed)

### Economic Insights

**Rendering fat is non-negotiable:**
- +80 sp profit for 8 hours work
- = 10 sp/hour (250% of journeyman wage)
- Only excuse not to render: No time, no equipment, or selling whole carcass to butcher

**Smoking meat is marginal:**
- +16 sp value gain (fresh → smoked roasts)
- -11 sp supplies, -14 hours labor
- Net: +5 sp profit
- **Do it for:** Storage needs, premium market, smokehouse already available
- **Skip it for:** Immediate sale, urban market with refrigeration

**Jerky is about utility, not profit:**
- Minimal profit gain (break-even)
- Value is portability + shelf life
- **Make it:** For travel, winter provisions, specialty market
- **Skip it:** If selling fresh locally

**Pelt tanning is optional:**
- +10-20 sp value (professional tan)
- -15 sp cost = -5 to +5 sp net
- **Do it:** Trophy-quality pelts, premium buyers
- **Skip it:** Standard pelts, fur traders (buy raw)

**Optimal strategy for most hunters:**
- Always render fat (huge profit, minimal effort)
- Smoke IF you have smokehouse access (modest profit, good storage)
- Sell pelts raw unless premium specimen
- Sell fresh meat to butcher (avoid retail fabrication labor)

**Result:** 28-33 gp profit in 2-3 days work (very good for level 1-3 party)

## PROFESSIONAL NOTES

### From Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher

**"Learn on Black Bears Before Attempting Others"**

*"In 132 years, I've seen too many apprentices skip black bears and go straight for polar bears or grizzlies. Bad idea. Black bears teach you the fundamentals - field dressing in good conditions, standard processing times, moderate size, forgiving cuts. Get good at these first.*

*Polar bears are 800 pounds in -40°F weather. Grizzlies are CR 2 and will kill you if you botch the shot. Cave bears require mountain climbing. Start simple. Master black bears, then move up."*

---

**"Bear Grease Economics Are Simple"**

*"30 pounds of fat. Render it, get 125 silver. Don't render it, sell for 45 silver. That's 80 silver profit for 8 hours work. Your labor's worth 10 sp/hour, and journeyman rate is 4 sp/hour.*

*I don't care if you're tired, if you're bored, if rendering fat is tedious. It's 80 silver. That's not optional. That's the bear's value. Don't leave it on the table."*

---

**"Fall Timing Matters More Than You Think"**

*"Early October - perfect. Bears are fat, pelts are good, prices are baseline, not too much competition.*

*Late November - bears are even fatter, pelts are perfect... and prices drop 20-30% because every hunter in Western Faerûn is selling. Supply and demand.*

*Hunt smart. Hunt when others aren't. September or early October. Not late November."*

---

**"Don't Process in Summer Unless Desperate"**

*"Summer bears: thin pelts, low fat, rapid spoilage risk, fly contamination. Not worth it.*

*Only hunt summer bears if you're starving or it's a problem bear (settlement protection). Otherwise, wait for fall. Quality matters, and summer bears are poor quality."*

---

### From Helena Fairstock, Master Provisioner

**"Waterdeep Market Saturation Is Real"**

*"October 1st: Black bear backstrap steaks sell for 4 sp each in Waterdeep. Prime demand, low supply.*

*November 20th: Same steaks sell for 2.5-3 sp each. Why? Every hunter from Neverwinter Wood to Cloakwood just flooded the market.*

*If you're selling fresh, sell early (September-early October). If you're preserving, sell in winter/spring when fresh is scarce. Know your market timing."*

---

**"Rendered Bear Grease Sells Itself"**

*"Fresh bear fat: Niche buyers (renderers, soap makers). Price: 1-2 sp/lb.*

*Rendered bear grease: Universal buyers (cooks, leatherworkers, healers, everyone). Price: 4-6 sp/lb.*

*One has limited market, one has unlimited market. Render the fat. Always."*

---

**"Know When to Sell Whole vs Retail"**

*"If you're within 6 hours of a butcher, sell the whole carcass. They'll pay 15-20 gp and you avoid 20 hours of processing labor.*

*If you're 2+ days from a butcher, process it yourself. Meat will spoil in transport. Do it right there.*

*Don't process in town if you can sell whole. Don't transport fresh if you're too far. Spoilage = total loss."*

---

**"Pelts Are Seasonal Profit"**

*"November black bear pelt (full winter coat, perfect): 25-35 sp in Waterdeep.*

*June black bear pelt (shedding, thin): 8-12 sp.*

*That's a 200% price swing based on calendar. If you're hunting for pelts, hunt November. If you're hunting for meat, September-October. Different priorities, different timing."*

## CULTURAL NOTES

**Sword Coast Frontier Traditions:**

- Fall bear hunting = community event (multiple families hunt together)
- Shared smokehouses (communal preservation, reduces individual cost)
- Bear grease rendered in large batches (efficiency)
- Traditional recipes passed down (bear stew, smoked ham, jerky seasoning)

**Urban Markets (Waterdeep, Neverwinter):**

- Bear meat = "wild game" category (premium over cattle, less than venison)
- Specialty taverns feature seasonal bear dishes (fall menu items)
- Bear grease sold in apothecaries (medicinal), leatherworkers (waterproofing), cooks (frying)

**Regional Preferences:**

- **North (Neverwinter, Luskan):** Prefer smoked bear, rendered grease (winter essentials)
- **South (Baldur's Gate, Amn):** Exotic game meat (less common, premium pricing)
- **Frontier (Daggerford, Triboar, Phandalin):** Subsistence hunting (feed families, not profit)

**Religious/Cultural:**

- No major taboos against bear meat in Western Faerûn
- Some Northern tribes (Uthgardt) have ritual bear hunts (respect, not prohibition)
- Bear paws = taboo in some cultures (resemblance to human hands)

---

**This baseline breed establishes all standards. Every other bear breed in this guide references these specifications with variations: "Yields +2% fat vs black bear," "20% larger than black bear," "Same processing as black bear, but requires 4 additional hours due to size."**

**Master the Sword Coast black bear, and you've mastered the foundation of all bear processing in Western Faerûn.**

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**
