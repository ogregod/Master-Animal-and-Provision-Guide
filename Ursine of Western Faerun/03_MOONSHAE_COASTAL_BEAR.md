# MOONSHAE COASTAL BEAR
## *Ursus maritimus moonshae* - The Salmon-Fed Delicacy

**ORIGIN:** Moonshae Isles, coastal Sword Coast
**PRIMARY ROLE:** Premium salmon-fed meat (+20% flavor premium), water-resistant pelt
**MARKET POSITION:** Seafood markets, island communities, coastal specialty
**PROCESSING DIFFICULTY:** Moderate (island access, seasonal timing, cultural sensitivity)
**UNIQUE FEATURE:** Salmon-fed flavor (sweet, rich meat) + water-resistant pelt (sailors/fishermen)

---

## BREED OVERVIEW & IMPORTANCE

The Moonshae coastal bear is the **gourmet's bear**. Diet = flavor, and coastal bears eat salmon. Fresh Atlantic salmon, rich in oils, feeding for months before hibernation. The result? Sweet, rich bear meat that sells for 20-30% premium over forest-fed black bears. Waterdeep seafood markets pay extra specifically for "salmon bear" meat. Add a water-resistant pelt (valued by sailors), and you have a coastal specialty breed.

**Why This Breed Matters:**
- **Salmon-Fed Flavor:** Sweet, rich, less gamey (+20-30% pricing premium over standard bear)
- **Seasonal Peak:** Sept-Oct after salmon runs (fattiest, best flavor)
- **Water-Resistant Pelt:** Naturally water-repellent (valued by sailors, fishermen, coastal communities)
- **Island Culture:** Northlander traditions (hunting festivals, cultural significance)
- **Seafood Market:** Waterdeep fish markets (salmon bear marketed like premium seafood)
- **Moderate Size:** 400 lbs average (easier processing than large bears)

**Market Position:**
- **Waterdeep seafood markets:** Premium pricing (salmon bear = specialty product)
- **Caer Callidyrr (Moonshae):** Local market (good prices, no transport)
- **Island communities:** Traditional diet, cultural significance
- **Coastal taverns:** Specialty menu item (salmon-fed bear roast)

**Processing Reality Check:**
- **Island Access:** Requires boat (10-30 gp passage to Moonshae)
- **Seasonal Window:** Sept-Oct optimal (post-salmon run fattening)
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Northlander permissions (tribal protocols)
- **Total Revenue:** 45-55 gp (400 lb bear with flavor premium)

**Professional Perspective:**
*"Salmon-fed bear tastes different. Sweeter, richer, less of that forest-game flavor. Waterdeep customers who won't touch standard bear will pay premium for coastal bear. It's all about that diet."*
**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

### Primary Range (Uncommon - Island/Coastal)

**Moonshae Isles (Core Territory):**
- **Population:** Uncommon (120-180 individuals across isles)
- **Islands:** Alaron, Gwynneth, Moray (largest populations)
- **Access:** Boat required (10-30 gp passage from Sword Coast)
- **Hunting:** **Northlander tribal permissions required** (cultural protocols)
- **Habitat:** Coastal forests, salmon rivers, beach zones
- **Notes:** Highest concentration, best salmon runs

**Sword Coast Beaches (Secondary Range):**
- **Population:** Rare (30-60 individuals, scattered)
- **Locations:** Trackless Sea coast, river mouths
- **Access:** 1-3 days from coastal settlements
- **Hunting:** Generally open (away from tribal territories)
- **Habitat:** Coastal zones where rivers meet ocean

### Seasonal Behavior (CRITICAL - Tied to Salmon Runs)

**Spring-Summer (Mar-Aug): Dispersed**
- Bears range widely (berries, small animals, opportunistic feeding)
- Difficult to locate (spread across islands/coast)
- Lean condition (not fattening yet)

**Fall (Sept-Oct): SALMON RUN - CONCENTRATED**
- **All bears gather at salmon rivers** (predictable locations)
- **Feeding frenzy:** Bears eat 20-30 lbs salmon per day
- **Rapid fattening:** Gain 50-80 lbs in 4-6 weeks
- **Easiest hunting:** Bears focused on fishing, less wary

**Winter (Nov-Feb): Denning**
- Hibernation (coastal caves, dense thickets)
- Off-limits (ethical/legal restrictions)

**Professional Timing:** **Early-mid October = optimal** (peak fat from salmon, still accessible)

## ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

### Salmon-Fed Premium = Profit Driver

**Coastal Bear (400 lbs):**
- Revenue: 50-58 gp
- Costs: Boat (20 gp), processing (90 sp), tanning (15 sp)
- **Total Costs:** 30.5 gp
- **NET PROFIT:** 19.5-27.5 gp

**Black Bear (300 lbs, no premium):**
- Revenue: 36 gp
- Costs: Processing (10.4 gp)
- **NET PROFIT:** 25.6 gp

**Interesting:** Similar profit despite higher revenue, due to island access costs.

**When Coastal Bear Makes Sense:**
- Already on Moonshae (zero boat cost)
- Hunting multiple bears (amortize boat cost)
- Direct Waterdeep sale (capture full premium)
- Cultural experience (Northlander traditions, island adventure)

---

## CULTURAL NOTES - **IMPORTANT**

### Northlander Tribal Protocols

**MUST Request Permission:**
- Approach ffolk village elders (respectfully, bring small gifts 5-10 sp value)
- Explain purpose (commercial hunting, subsistence, opportunistic)
- Offer tribute (10-20% of harvest as payment)
- **Do NOT hunt without permission** (cultural offense, possible violence)

**Sacred Sites:**
- Some salmon rivers are protected (ancestral fishing grounds)
- Autumn bear festivals (Sept-Oct, DO NOT hunt during festivals)
- Respect albino bears or legendary individuals (may be spiritually significant)

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Learn local customs before hunting
- Honor agreements (if you promise 20% tribute, deliver it)
- Build relationships (repeat hunting requires good reputation)

**Consequences of Violation:**
- Tribal bans (can't return)
- Physical confrontation (ffolk warriors defend territory)
- Damage to regional reputation (news spreads between islands)

## PROFESSIONAL NOTES

### From Thadius Del Irontet

**"Diet = Flavor"**

*"Salmon-fed bear doesn't taste like forest bear. Sweeter, richer, less gamey. That's not marketing - that's biology. Salmon is fatty, omega-rich. Bear eats 500 pounds of salmon in 6 weeks, you taste it in the meat.*

*Waterdeep buyers know this. They'll pay 4-5 silver per steak for coastal bear vs 3-4 silver for forest bear. Same cut, better flavor, premium price."*

---

### From Helena Fairstock

**"Seasonal Timing Is Everything"**

*"Hunt too early (August): Bears aren't fat yet, lean meat, no flavor premium.*

*Hunt during salmon run (Sept-Oct): Peak fat, peak flavor, premium prices.*

*Hunt too late (November): Bears entering dens, hard to find.*

*Two-week window (early-mid October) = optimal. Plan accordingly."*

---

**"Island Economics"**

*"20 gold for boat passage (round trip). That's 40% of your profit.*

*Solutions:*
*1. Hunt multiple bears (2-3 bears = amortize boat cost)*
*2. Already on Moonshae (quest, other business = zero boat cost)*
*3. Contract with island buyer (sell on Moonshae, avoid return shipping)*

*Don't pay 20 gold transport to make 20 gold profit. Do the math."*

---

**Coastal bears are premium flavor specialists - salmon-fed meat commands 20-30% premium in Waterdeep markets. Best hunted during fall salmon runs (Sept-Oct) with cultural sensitivity to Northlander traditions. Island access costs require planning, but flavor premium justifies investment.**
