The Master Butcher's Guide
Volume I: The Owlbear (That Damn Feathered Bear)
Written by: Garrick Ironknife, Master Butcher

For: Anyone fool enough to kill one of these things

Date: After 30+ years of cutting meat and about 47 owlbears

Listen. I've been butchering owlbears since before you were born, and I'm writing this down because I'm tired of watching good meat get ruined by idiots who think they can just hack away at a 1,400 pound chimera like it's a deer. This isn't a deer. This isn't even close to a deer. This is half bird, half bear, and all profit if you don't screw it up.

So sit down, shut up, and pay attention. I'm only writing this once.

What You're Looking At
When you kill an owlbear (or more likely, when some adventurers drag one to your shop and demand you "do something with it"), you've got about 1,420 pounds of dead weight on your hands. That's assuming they already bled it out in the field, which, if they're smart, they did. If they didn't, add another 115 pounds of blood and a huge mess.

The breakdown you need to know:

External materials (hide, feathers, trophies): 183 lbs → 200 gold

Retail cuts (steaks, roasts): 575 lbs → 483-531 gold

Sausage from trim: 70 lbs → 70 gold

Bone stock: 70 lbs bones → 40 gold

Rendered tallow: 99 lbs → 20 gold

Total value: 813-861 gold depending on whether you sell the tenderloin or keep it (and you should keep it, but we'll get to that).

Processing time: About 14 hours with a crew of 4 people who know what they're doing.

Operating costs: 72-103 gold for labor, salt, spices, ice, supplies (guild vs. independent).

Your profit: 741-789 gold for two days of work.

That's better than a month's worth of cows, and about 40 times more profitable than deer. The only catch is that owlbears try to kill you before you kill them. But that's the adventurers' problem, not yours.

How to Use This Guide
This is organized by processing order:

External materials - Strip these off first (hide, feathers, trophies, organs)

Anatomy - Understanding the two halves (bird and bear)

Scraps - Making sausage, stock, and tallow from what's left

Accounting - Where every pound goes

Warnings - The musk gland and other ways to ruin everything

Economics - What it's all worth

Template - How to apply this to other creatures

Read the warnings section. Seriously. The musk gland alone can cost you 150 gold if you screw it up.

Now let's get to work.

Chapter 1: The Field Harvest (External Materials)
The Stuff You Sell Before You Even Touch the Meat
Before you even THINK about cutting steaks, you strip off everything the artisans will buy. This is easy money, and you're a fool if you skip it.

You should make about 200 gold just from this crap.

The Hide (115 lbs)
This is the first thing off. The hide on an owlbear is weird - it starts as thick bear leather around the legs and belly, then transitions into this feathered weave up near the shoulders. Tanners go nuts for it. They call it "feather-leather" and they make those fancy Cloaks of Protection out of it.

What it's worth: 105 gold if you sell it as-is (bulk sale to a tanner). If you know how to process leather yourself and square it up properly, you can get 135 gold, but that's a lot of work and frankly not worth your time unless business is slow.

How to remove it: Sharp knife, patience, and for the love of the gods, DON'T POKE HOLES IN IT. Every knife mark drops the value. Start at the legs, work your way up. The hide comes off easier if the carcass is still warm - after about 6 hours it starts to stiffen up and you'll be fighting it.

Personal note: I once watched an apprentice try to remove a hide with a dull knife. Took him four hours and the hide looked like he'd fought a goblin war on it. Sold for 30 gold instead of 100. He's not my apprentice anymore.

The Feathers (8 lbs, comes off with the hide)
When you skin the shoulders and wings, you get two types of feathers. The big stiff ones (about 5 pounds worth) and the soft downy stuff underneath (about 3 pounds).

Stiff contour feathers: Fletchers buy these. One owlbear gives you enough for 600+ arrows. 30 gold.

Down feathers: Scribes want these for quills, and rich people stuff pillows with them. 10 gold.

Pack them separately. Keep them DRY. Wet feathers are worth exactly nothing.

Total for feathers: 40 gold

Trophy Parts (35 lbs)
People want owlbear parts for all kinds of reasons. Decorations, weapons, weird druid rituals, I don't ask.

The Beak (18 lbs): That massive ivory beak. Weaponsmiths like them for pommels, collectors mount them on walls, druids do... druid things with them. 20 gold.

The Talons (17 lbs total): Two big primary talons (6 pounds each) plus six smaller ones on the back toes. People make dagger hilts out of them, or grind them up for medicine. I don't get it either. 10 gold for the lot.

Cut these at the joint. Clean them with vinegar or they'll rot and stink up your shop for weeks. Learn from my mistakes.

Total for trophies: 30 gold

Arcane Viscera - HARVEST THESE FIRST (25 lbs)
Okay, this is important. As soon as that owlbear is dead - I mean IMMEDIATELY - you need to get the magical organs out. They're only good for alchemy if they're fresh. Wait too long and they're worthless.

You need:

Heart (8 lbs): Still pumping when you cut it out if you're fast. Alchemists make Potions of Heroism from these.

Liver (14 lbs, both lobes): Antitoxins and poison resistance potions.

Eyes (both of them, about 2.5 lbs total): Darkvision potions. Sometimes True Seeing if you get lucky.

Gall Bladder (half a pound of the most bitter thing you've ever smelled): Transformation magic ingredients.

How to preserve them: Jar of high-proof alcohol (the cheap stuff is fine), or pack them in salt brine, or if you're in the field, just ice. They need to be cold.

What they're worth: 25 gold to an alchemist, but only if they're fresh. Old organs? Maybe 5 gold as "practice materials."

Total for organs: 25 gold

Summary: External Materials
Material	Weight	Value
Hide	115 lbs	105 gp
Plumage (feathers)	8 lbs	40 gp
Trophy parts (beak + talons)	35 lbs	30 gp
Arcane viscera (organs)	25 lbs	25 gp
TOTAL	183 lbs	200 gp

Everything above adds up to about 200 gold, and you haven't cut a single steak yet.

That's 183 pounds of non-meat materials. The rest? That's where it gets interesting.

Next: Chapter 2 - Understanding Owlbear Anatomy

Chapter 2: Understanding Owlbear Anatomy
Or: Why This Is Two Jobs, Not One
Here's the thing about owlbears that makes them a pain in the ass: they're not one animal. They're two animals stitched together by some insane wizard centuries ago. The top half is bird. The bottom half is bear. And you CANNOT butcher them the same way.

I'm serious about this. I've seen people try to treat the whole thing like beef and they end up with 300 pounds of shoe leather because they cooked it wrong.

The numbers you need to know:

Total edible meat: 575 pounds

Trim for sausage: 70 pounds

Everything else: Bones, fat, guts, waste

575 pounds of retail cuts is what you're aiming for. That's 40% of the whole carcass, which is damn good for a wild animal. Most game you're lucky to get 30%.

The Avian Half (Chest and Wings) - 240 pounds
This is the top half. Dark red meat, almost no fat, tastes like if venison and duck had a baby. Very lean, very iron-y, and it will get tough as boot leather if you overcook it.

THE PECTORALS (170 lbs from the chest)
These are the crushing muscles. When an owlbear grabs something and squeezes? These are doing the work. Huge slabs of muscle running vertical from the breastbone to the shoulder.

You break these down three ways:

1. Owlbear Filet (the inner pectoral, dead center)
This is your money cut. 24 steaks, 3 pounds each, 72 pounds total. This is the owlbear version of filet mignon. Stupid tender if you cook it right (sear it rare, rest it, don't you dare cook it past medium).

Yield: 24 steaks × 3 lbs = 72 lbs

Price: 6 gold per steak

Total value: 144 gold

2. Hunter's Steak (the outer pectoral)
The outer part of the chest muscles. Not as tender, but still good. 33 steaks, 2 pounds each, 66 pounds total. You'll want to marinate these for at least 4 hours before grilling.

Yield: 33 steaks × 2 lbs = 66 lbs

Price: 2 gold per steak

Total value: 66 gold

3. Pectoral Trim (the edges and scraps)
Everything that doesn't cut into a clean steak. One big bag, about 32 pounds. Sell it for stir fry, stew meat, or kebabs.

Yield: 32 lbs

Price: 16 gold for the whole bag

Total value: 16 gold

THE WINGS (70 lbs from the forearms)
These aren't wings like a chicken. These are huge muscular arms with vestigial feathers. They're tough. I mean TOUGH. So much connective tissue you could make glue out of them.

Wing Flats (bone-in sections)
14 pieces, 5 pounds each, 70 pounds total. You have exactly two options: smoke them for 12+ hours until they fall off the bone, or braise them in beer and root vegetables for half a day. There is no third option. If you try to grill these, you'll break teeth.

Yield: 14 sections × 5 lbs = 70 lbs

Price: 5 silver per piece

Total value: 7 gold

Avian Section Summary
Cut	Quantity	Unit Weight	Total Weight	Price Each	Total Value
Owlbear Filet	24	3 lbs	72 lbs	6 gp	144 gp
Hunter's Steak	33	2 lbs	66 lbs	2 gp	66 gp
Pectoral Trim	1 bag	32 lbs	32 lbs	16 gp	16 gp
Wing Flats	14	5 lbs	70 lbs	5 sp	7 gp
TOTAL			240 lbs		233 gp

The Ursine Half (Legs, Back, Belly) - 335 pounds
This is the bear half. Rich, fatty, sweet game meat. Marbled like crazy, tastes like the best wild boar you've ever had. This is where the money is.

THE SADDLE (the back and loin, 80 lbs)
The meat along the spine, protected by the ribcage. This is premium stuff.

1. Grizzly T-Bone (from the short loin)
Massive steaks cut right through the spine bone. Each one is a feast for 2-3 people. 13 steaks, 3 pounds each, 39 pounds. Just salt and pepper, sear them hard, serve them proud.

Yield: 13 steaks × 3 lbs = 39 lbs

Price: 4 gold per steak

Total value: 52 gold

2. Ribeye Steak (from the front ribs)
The most flavorful steak on the whole animal. Fat marbling throughout. 22 steaks, 1.5 pounds each, 33 pounds. Cast iron, high heat, generous salt.

Yield: 22 steaks × 1.5 lbs = 33 lbs

Price: 2 gold per steak

Total value: 44 gold

3. Tenderloin (hidden inside the ribcage)
The butcher's cut. This is tradition - you don't sell this. You take it home. 2 roasts, 4 pounds each, 8 pounds total. Soft as butter, melts in your mouth.

Yield: 2 roasts × 4 lbs = 8 lbs

Price: 24 gold per roast (if you sell it, which you shouldn't)

Total value: 48 gold (but you're keeping this)

THE HAUNCHES (the legs, 160 lbs)
The working muscles. Dense meat, needs slow cooking.

1. Iron Roast (top round from the hind legs)
Big cylindrical roasts you tie up with twine. Braise these low and slow with vegetables and dark beer. 10 roasts, 10 pounds each, 100 pounds. Feeds 8-12 people.

Yield: 10 roasts × 10 lbs = 100 lbs

Price: 5 gold per roast

Total value: 50 gold

2. Leg Steak (bottom round)
Thinner steaks from the lower part of the leg. Quick-cooking, budget-friendly. Good for stew meat too. 20 steaks, 1 pound each, 20 pounds.

Yield: 20 steaks × 1 lb = 20 lbs

Price: 1 gold per steak

Total value: 20 gold

3. Shank (lower leg, bone-in)
Cross-cut through the leg bone so you can get at the marrow. These are your peasant food - cheap, but if you cook them right (3+ hours simmering), they're incredible. 8 shanks, 5 pounds each, 40 pounds.

Yield: 8 shanks × 5 lbs = 40 lbs

Price: 1 gold per shank

Total value: 8 gold

THE BELLY & FLANK (95 lbs)
Layers of fat and meat, just like pork belly, plus the lower abdominal muscles.

1. Green Bacon (the whole belly, cut into slabs)
This is what everyone asks for. Cure it in salt for a week, smoke it for 8 hours. Best bacon you'll ever have. 5 slabs, 10 pounds each, 50 pounds.

Yield: 5 slabs × 10 lbs = 50 lbs

Price: 10 gold per slab

Total value: 50 gold

2. Skirt Steak (the diaphragm muscle)
Thin, loose-grained meat from the breathing muscle. Grill it FAST over super high heat (like 90 seconds per side), slice it thin, put it in fajitas. 5 steaks, 2 pounds each, 10 pounds.

Yield: 5 steaks × 2 lbs = 10 lbs

Price: 1 gold per steak

Total value: 5 gold

3. Brisket & Flank (lower chest and abdominal)
Tough, flavorful cuts that need long smoking or stewing. Often overlooked, but excellent for heavy feasts.

Yield: 35 lbs bulk

Price: 6 sp per lb

Total value: 21 gold

*Tenderloin traditionally kept by butcher, not sold

Complete Retail Summary
Avian section: 240 lbs = 233 gold

Ursine section: 335 lbs = 298 gold (with tenderloin) or 250 gold (without)

Total retail cuts: 575 pounds

Total value:

531 gold (if you sell tenderloin - you shouldn't)

483 gold (traditional - you keep the tenderloin)

And we're not done yet. We still have 70 pounds of trim to turn into sausage.

Next: Chapter 3 - What to Do With the Scraps

Chapter 3: What to Do With the Scraps
Because We Don't Waste Anything
You've got all these nice steaks cut. Great. Now you've got about 70 pounds of trim sitting on your cutting table - neck meat, rib scraps, leg edges, all the bits that didn't make pretty steaks.

This is sausage.

Hunter's Sausage (70 lbs → ~187 links)
What goes in it:

Wing trim: 13 lbs

Leg trim: 40 lbs

Neck and rib scraps: 17 lbs

Total: 70 lbs

The mix: 60% lean meat, 40% fat. You add belly fat trimmings to balance it out. This ratio is self-basting - you don't need oil when you cook it.

The Spice Recipe
For every 10 pounds of meat, you need:

Fresh sage: 1.5 tbsp per batch (about 4.5 tsp)
Source: Daggerford Sage (Common, 3 sp per bunch)

Each bunch: 0.06 lbs (1 oz) with soft velvety leaves, 24 uses (1 use ≈ 1 tablespoon fresh)

For 70 lbs meat (7 batches): Need about 10.5 tablespoons total (31.5 tsp)

Purchase: 2 bunches at 3 sp each = 6 sp (retail)

Guild price: About 4 sp (bulk discount from herb farms)

Storage: Hang upside-down in cool, dry place for 2 weeks to dry (reduces to half weight, doubles shelf life to 6 months)

Note: Fresh is better for sausage - more aromatic oils. Dried works but use half as much.

Juniper berries: 1 tsp per batch, crushed
Source: Juniper Berries (Uncommon, 5 sp per package)

Each package: 0.06 lbs (1 oz) of dried blue-black berries, 20 uses (1 use ≈ 1 tsp)

For 70 lbs meat (7 batches): Need 7 tsp total

Purchase: 1 package at 5 sp = 5 sp (retail)

Guild price: About 3 sp (imported goods, harder to get discounts)

Note: These are dried berries. Crush them with mortar and pestle just before use - releases the piney, slightly sweet oils. Don't crush ahead of time or they go stale.

Black pepper: 1 tsp per batch, coarse ground
Source: Peppercorns (Common, 1 gp per package)

Each package: 0.06 lbs (1 oz) of hard black spheres, 24 uses when ground (1 use ≈ 1 tsp)

For 70 lbs meat (7 batches): Need 7 tsp total

Purchase: 1 package at 1 gp = 1 gp (retail)

Guild price: About 6 sp (still expensive - it's imported from southern trade routes)

Note: Buy whole peppercorns, grind coarse yourself. Pre-ground loses flavor in a week. Toast them lightly in a dry pan before grinding for deeper flavor.

Garlic: 4 cloves, minced
Source: Trielta Hills Garlic (Common, 2 cp per bulb)

Each bulb: 0.1 lbs (small papery bulb) containing 9 cloves typically

For 70 lbs meat: Need 28 cloves total (about 4 bulbs)

Purchase: 4 bulbs at 2 cp each = 8 cp

Note: Pungent raw, mellow when cooked into sausage. Mince fine - big chunks burn during cooking. Each clove is about the size of your thumb (smaller cloves in the center, bigger on the outside).

Salt: 2 tsp
Source: Sea Salt (Common, 1 cp per pound)

Each pound: 96 teaspoons (coarse white crystals)

For 70 lbs meat: Need 14 tsp for seasoning the sausage

Purchase: 1 lb at 1 cp = 1 cp (for sausage seasoning only)

Note: This is JUST for sausage seasoning. Curing bacon and general preservation require much more (see separate sections below).

Fennel seed: 1 tsp (if you like a little sweetness - I do)
Source: Fennel Seed (Common, 4 sp per package)

Each package: 0.06 lbs (1 oz) of green-brown licorice-scented seeds, 20 uses

For 70 lbs meat: Need 7 tsp total

Purchase: 1 package at 4 sp = 4 sp

Note: Optional but highly recommended. Adds subtle sweetness that balances the gamey wild flavor. Some people don't like licorice notes - skip if that's you.

Spice Cost Breakdown
At retail prices (what you'd pay at market if you walk up and buy one batch worth):

Ingredient	Quantity Needed	Unit Price	Total Cost
Daggerford Sage	2 bunches	3 sp each	6 sp
Juniper Berries	1 package	5 sp each	5 sp
Peppercorns	1 package	1 gp each	1 gp
Trielta Hills Garlic	4 bulbs	2 cp each	8 cp
Sea Salt	1 lb	1 cp	1 cp
Fennel Seed	1 package	4 sp	4 sp
TOTAL			2 gp, 5 sp, 9 cp

Export to Sheets

At guild bulk prices (what I actually pay with connections):

Category	Guild Price
Fresh herbs (sage, garlic, fennel)	9 sp (cheaper buying bulk fresh)
Imported spices (pepper, juniper)	9 sp (guild import connections)
Salt	1 cp (same - it's already cheap)
TOTAL	1 gp, 9 cp

Export to Sheets

At grow-your-own prices (if you have a garden and some land):

Item	Cost
Sage	Free (perennial plant, harvest for years)
Garlic	2 cp (you still need to buy seed garlic or save bulbs)
Fennel	Free (reseeds itself, grows like a weed in most climates)
Juniper	5 sp (still need to buy - doesn't grow reliably here)
Pepper	1 gp (can't grow in this climate - tropical plant)
Salt	1 cp
TOTAL	1 gp, 8 cp

Export to Sheets

My recommendation: Join the guild or make friends with someone who has. The bulk discount on spices alone pays for guild membership (60 gp per year) after processing just 4-5 owlbears.

If you're an independent butcher or adventurer doing this once, budget 3 gp for spices at retail prices and don't be surprised when it costs that much. Quality ingredients aren't cheap, and cheap ingredients ruin expensive meat.

Additional Sausage Supplies
Beyond spices, you need:

Natural Hog Casings
Cost: 3 gp for enough to make 187 links (35mm diameter)

Source: Butcher supply shops, some general stores

Note: Pre-salted and preserved. Rinse thoroughly before use (they're SALTY). Could use owlbear intestines but it's a huge pain - see note below.

Why not owlbear intestines? You CAN use them, but:

Takes 3-4 hours to clean them properly (inside AND out)

Inconsistent diameter (some links fat, some thin)

Smell terrible during cleaning

Still cost you 2 gp in salt and labor

Commercial hog casings cost 3 gp and save you half a day. Worth it.

Mixing and Stuffing
Grind meat and fat together (60% lean, 40% fat ratio)

Mix in all spices thoroughly with clean hands

Let rest in cold place for 2-4 hours (flavors blend)

Stuff into casings using sausage stuffer

Twist into 6-ounce links

Hang to dry for 1 hour before cooking or smoking

The Numbers
Yield: About 187 links at 6 oz each

What it's worth:

Bulk sale (just the ground meat, no casing): 1 gold per pound = 70 gold

Individual links (more work): 5 silver per link = 93 gold, 5 sp

Most days I sell it bulk. Time is money, and I've got other work to do.

How to Cook It
Pan fry: Medium heat, 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally. Don't poke holes (loses juices).

Grill: Medium-direct heat, 10-12 minutes. The fat will drip and cause flare-ups - watch it.

Smoke: 180°F for 2-3 hours over hickory or apple wood. Amazing flavor.

Goes great with mustard and dark bread. Some people like them with sauerkraut. Taverns serve them with mashed potatoes and ale.

Storage
Fresh: 3 days refrigerated (below 40°F)

Smoked: 10 days refrigerated

Frozen: 6 months if wrapped tightly (prevents freezer burn)

Bone Stock (from 70 lbs of premium bones)
The skeleton on an owlbear is about 213 pounds total. Most of it's junk, but you want to save the good bones:

Premium bones to save:

Femurs (the big leg bones): 20 lbs total - split them lengthwise for the marrow

Knuckles (joints): 15 lbs total - these have tons of gelatin

Neck vertebrae: 35 lbs total - lots of marrow pockets

Total: 70 pounds of premium soup bones

The remaining 143 pounds of skeleton (ribs, skull, wing bones, small stuff) you can use for secondary stock or just sell to farmers for bone meal. 5 gold if you're lucky.

How to Make Proper Stock
Roast the bones at 425°F for 45 minutes. You want them BROWN, not burnt. This develops deep flavor through caramelization.

Put them in your biggest pot. Cover with cold water (about 2 gallons for 70 lbs bones).

Add aromatics:

One large onion, quartered (skin on for color)

Source: Sword Coast Yellow Onions (Common, 2 cp per mesh bag)

Each bag: 1 lb with golden-brown skin, crisp white flesh, 3 uses

Need: 1 onion (about 0.5 lbs)

Cost: 1 cp

Note: Don't peel it - the papery skin adds golden color to stock

Two carrots, chopped rough

Source: Silverymoon Carrots (Common, 5 cp per bunch)

Each bunch: 1 lb of slender bright orange roots, 4 uses

Need: 2 carrots (about 0.5 lbs)

Cost: 3 cp

Note: Don't bother peeling - you're straining this out anyway

Two celery ribs

Source: Celery (Common, 3 cp per bundle)

Each bundle: 0.75 lbs of ribbed stalks with leaves, 10 uses

Need: 2 ribs (about 0.15 lbs)

Cost: 1 cp

Note: Use the leafy tops too - adds flavor

Two bay leaves

Source: Bay Leaves (Common, 3 sp per package)

Each package: 0.06 lbs of stiff dried oval leaves, 15 uses

Need: 2 leaves

Cost: 4 cp (2 cp per leaf)

Note: Dried is fine. Don't use fresh bay - too bitter.

Ten peppercorns

Source: Peppercorns (already bought for sausage)

Need: 10 whole peppercorns

Cost: included in sausage purchase

Note: Don't grind them - whole peppercorns in stock, grind for sausage

Bring to a simmer. Not a rolling boil - that makes the stock cloudy and bitter. Just gentle bubbles.

Skim the scum off the top for the first 30 minutes. This is coagulated proteins and impurities. Gross but necessary.

Let it simmer for 24-36 hours. Add water when it gets low. The longer you cook it, the richer it gets. Some people go 48 hours. I think that's excessive, but you do you.

Strain it through cloth. Cheesecloth or clean linen. Throw away the solids - they've given everything they have.

Reduce it by half. Boil it down until it's thick and syrupy. You end up with "bone glace" - super concentrated stock.

Aromatics Cost for Stock
Ingredient	Amount	Cost
Sword Coast Yellow Onions	1 onion	1 cp
Silverymoon Carrots	2 carrots	3 cp
Celery	2 ribs	1 cp
Bay Leaves	2 leaves	4 cp
Peppercorns	10 whole	(included above)
TOTAL		9 cp

Export to Sheets

Cheap stuff. The bones are doing all the heavy lifting here.

The Results
Yield: 8 quarts of concentrated bone glace

What it's worth: 5 gold per quart = 40 gold total

What it does: This stock is rich and restorative. One cup will warm you to your bones and settle the stomach of even the most seasick sailor. It's not magic, but it tastes like it.

Storage:

Refrigerated: 1 week

Frozen in jars: 6 months

Dried into bouillon cubes: 1 year (reduces to powder, reconstitute with water)

Rendered Tallow (99 lbs of pure cooking fat)
All that fat you trimmed off the belly and the legs? Don't throw it away. Render it.

How to Render
Cut the fat into 1-inch cubes. Smaller pieces melt faster and more evenly.

Put it in a huge pot on low heat. You want 200-250°F. Too hot and it burns (tastes terrible). Too low and it takes forever.

Let it slowly melt for 6-8 hours, stirring now and then. It'll bubble and hiss as water evaporates. That's normal.

Strain it through cloth into jars while it's hot. Don't let it cool in the pot - it'll stick like glue.

Let it cool and solidify. It'll turn from golden liquid to creamy white solid.

Yield: 99 pounds of tallow. Clear golden when liquid, creamy white when solid. Shelf-stable, good for a year at room temperature.

Uses for Tallow
Cooking - It's better than butter for high heat (smoke point of 420°F). Perfect for searing steaks, frying potatoes, making pastry crusts.

Soap making - Makes hard, long-lasting bars. Mix with lye and water. (Not covering that here - different guide.)

Leather conditioning - Waterproofs boots and belts. Rub into leather, let it soak in overnight.

Candle making - Burns three times longer than wax. Steady, bright flame.

Emergency lamp fuel - Works in a pinch if you run out of oil.

The crispy bits left over (we call them cracklins) are a nice salty snack. Sprinkle with salt while hot, eat with beer.

What It's Worth
Bulk sale: 2 silver per pound = about 20 gold

Jarred and clarified: 5 silver per pound = about 50 gold (but that's more work - cleaning jars, ladling carefully, labeling)

I usually sell it bulk unless I've got slow apprentices who need something to do.

Breaking Down the Arcane Viscera (25 lbs)
The magical organs you harvest first:

Heart: 8 lbs

Liver: 14 lbs (both lobes)

Eyes: 2.5 lbs (both eyes)

Gall Bladder: 0.5 lbs

Total: 25 lbs

These go to alchemists for 25 gold, but only if they're fresh.

Breaking Down the Skeleton (213 lbs total)
Premium bones (for stock): 70 lbs

Femurs: 20 lbs

Knuckles: 15 lbs

Neck vertebrae: 35 lbs

Remainder bones (secondary use): 143 lbs

Rib cage: 85 lbs

Skull: 30 lbs

Wing bones: 18 lbs

Small bones: 10 lbs

The remainder gets used for weaker stock or sold as bone meal (5 gold bulk).

Breaking Down the Non-Arcane Organs (95 lbs)
The guts (lungs, stomach, intestines, kidneys) are 95 pounds of stuff nobody really wants:

Lungs: 28 lbs - Spongy and gross. Compost it.

Stomach: 35 lbs - Tough as rope. Can be used as sausage casing but it's a pain. Usually composted.

Intestines: 22 lbs - Traditional sausage casings, but most butchers use commercial hog casings. Composted.

Kidneys: 6 lbs (pair) - Edible but acquired taste. Strong, gamey flavor. Some chefs use for pâté.

Spleen: 4 lbs - Not typically consumed. Composted.

Some people feed this to their dogs. I compost most of it. You might get 2-5 gold if you sell it to tanners or farmers, but it's not worth the hassle.

Weight Distribution as Percentages
If you want to apply this to other creatures, here are the rough percentages:

Component	Percentage	Owlbear Weight
External Materials	13%	183 lbs
Retail Meat	40%	575 lbs
Sausage/Trim	5%	70 lbs
Premium Bones	5%	70 lbs
Remainder Skeleton	10%	143 lbs
Rendered Fat	7%	99 lbs
Organs (non-magical)	7%	95 lbs
Blood	8%	115 lbs
Waste/Connective	5%	70 lbs
TOTAL	100%	1,420 lbs

Export to Sheets

The percentages shift depending on the creature (dragons have more external materials, fish have less skeleton), but this is a good starting point.

Common Questions
"Why is there so much waste?"
There isn't, really. That 70 pounds of "waste" is mostly:

Silver skin (connective membrane that's inedible)

Damaged sections from the kill

Sinew and tendons that don't break down

Fat that's too dirty or blood-soaked to render

It's about 5% of the carcass, which is actually really good. Most large animals are 10-15% waste.

"What about the blood?"
The 115 pounds of blood was drained in the field before transport. It's gone. Some cultures use blood for blood sausage, but most adventurers just let it drain out on the ground.

If you REALLY want to save it, you need to catch it in buckets immediately after the kill and whisk it constantly to prevent clotting. Then you can make blood sausage (black pudding). But that's another 2-3 hours of work and most people don't like the taste.

"Can I eat the organs?"
The arcane organs (heart, liver, eyes, gall bladder) are worth way more to alchemists than they are as food. Sell them.

The non-arcane organs? Technically edible, but nobody wants them. The kidneys have potential if you're into that sort of thing (strong, mineral flavor - some people love it, most don't). Everything else is compost.

"Why don't you use the intestines for sausage casings?"
You can, but it's a huge pain. You have to:

Turn them inside-out

Scrape out all the interior lining (takes 30 minutes per section)

Wash them 5-6 times in clean water

Soak in vinegar for 1 hour

Rinse again

Salt-pack them for storage

And they're STILL inconsistent in diameter and smell terrible.

Commercial hog casings cost 3 gold and save you 4 hours of miserable work. Worth it.

"What if I want to keep more than just the tenderloin?"
That's up to you. Some butchers keep:

Tenderloin (tradition)

Heart (if you like offal)

Ribeye steaks (best flavor)

Owlbear Filet (best tenderness)

Just don't get greedy. If you're keeping 50+ pounds of meat, you're hurting your profit margin. The tenderloin is the butcher's cut because it's small (8 lbs), premium quality, and symbolically important. Keeping more than that and you're just being cheap with your customers.

Chapter 5: How to Not Ruin 150 Gold Worth of Meat
Critical Warnings
Alright, now we get to the parts where apprentices screw up and cost me money.

THE MUSK GLAND - Do Not Puncture This
⚠️ THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THIS ENTIRE GUIDE ⚠️

There is a gland at the base of the tail, right where the spine meets the pelvis. It's about the size of a walnut, yellowish-tan color, buried in fat. This is the owlbear's scent gland. They use it to mark territory.

If you puncture this gland, it releases an oil that smells like a skunk died in a fire. And it SOAKS INTO THE MEAT. Instantly. You'll ruin 50-75 pounds of meat - everything within 2 feet of that gland.

My Story (Learn from My Mistake)
I once had an apprentice nick this gland while cutting the hindquarters. The smell was so bad we had to close the shop for two days. The meat was completely unsalvageable - even dogs wouldn't eat it. I lost 150 gold because he was in a hurry.

He's not my apprentice anymore.

How to Avoid This Disaster
FIND THE GLAND FIRST before you cut anything in the back half

Mark it with chalk so you know where it is

Use a SHARP knife to cut it out in a 3-inch circle (gives you safety margin)

Throw it away immediately, far from your work area

Wash your hands and knife with vinegar

What Happens If You Puncture It
50-75 lbs of meat ruined (everything within 2 feet)

Smells like burning skunk hair mixed with rancid oil

Tastes impossibly bitter - causes gagging in most people

Can't be saved by washing, soaking, or cooking

Worth exactly 0 gold

You lose 50-150 gold depending on which cuts you ruin

Don't. Puncture. The. Gland.

I can't emphasize this enough. This ruins more owlbear processing than anything else. Be slow, be careful, and FIND IT FIRST.

Recovery If You Screw Up
If you do puncture it:

Immediately cut away all meat within 2 feet of the gland

Salvage what you can from outside the contamination zone

Wash the area with vinegar (won't save the meat, but prevents further spread)

Accept your losses and move on

Don't make the same mistake twice

The Gizzard Stones (Free Treasure)
Now for something more pleasant. Owlbears don't have teeth for grinding food, so they swallow stones. The stones sit in a muscular pouch called a gizzard (up near the throat) and they grind up food through muscle contractions.

Cut open the gizzard. Sift through it. Sometimes you find actual treasure.

Where to Find It
The gizzard is in the upper digestive tract, between the stomach and the crop, near the base of the throat. It's a muscular sac about the size of a cantaloupe.

What to Do
Cut it open carefully (it's tough and muscular)

Sift through the contents with gloved hands

Wash all stones and objects thoroughly with water

Check for magic items (use Identify spell if you find jewelry)

What You Might Find
Most of the time (rolls 1-10 on a d20):

River stones (worthless, but good for sling ammunition)

Just smooth quartz, granite, or basalt

Sometimes (rolls 11-15):

Old coins, belt buckles, arrowheads from previous meals

Worth 1-5 gold as scrap metal

Evidence of past victims

Occasionally (rolls 16-19):

Semiprecious gems that got tumbled smooth by stomach acid

Agate, jasper, turquoise, poorly-cut garnets

Worth 10-50 gold - sellable to jewelers

Rarely (roll 20):

Magic rings, amulets, or other items that didn't digest

Worth 100-500 gold, maybe more

GET IT IDENTIFIED BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON

My Best Find
I found a Ring of Protection in a gizzard once. Changed my whole month. Paid for a new set of knives and had gold left over.

Caution
Gizzard contents are acidic (pH around 2-3). Rinse everything before pocketing.

Some items may be cursed. I know a guy who found a cursed ring this way. Not fun.

Partially digested remains may contain clues about recent victims. Report to local authorities if you find evidence of humanoid remains.

Typical haul: 5-20 gold in miscellaneous findings per owlbear. Occasionally a windfall.

Preservation and Spoilage
Meat goes bad. This is just physics. Above 40°F, bacteria doubles every 20 minutes.

Fresh Meat (Unprocessed)
Shelf life: 3 days in a cold cellar (below 40°F)

Signs of spoilage:

Slimy or sticky texture

Gray or green color

Sour smell (or worse, ammonia smell)

Gas bubbles under the surface

What to do: Throw it out. Just throw it out.

Don't even think about it: Don't sell spoiled meat. You'll poison someone, they'll get sick, and the guild will revoke your license. Your reputation is worth more than 50 gold.

Mechanical effect if sold: Constitution saving throw DC 13 or suffer Poisoned condition for 24 hours and take 2d6 poison damage. And then they'll sue you.

Bacon (Cured and Smoked)
Fresh after curing/smoking: 3 weeks in the cold

Frozen: 6 months (wrapped tightly to prevent freezer burn)

Best quality: Consume within 10 days for optimal flavor

Sausage
Fresh (uncooked): 3 days refrigerated

Cooked: 5-7 days refrigerated

Smoked: 10-14 days refrigerated

Frozen: 6 months (wrapped tightly)

Emergency Preservation - Jerky
If you can't sell the meat in 3 days, turn it into jerky. You lose weight, but you gain shelf life.

How to make jerky:

Slice meat into ¼-inch thick strips (cut against the grain for tenderness)

Salt cure: Coat generously with coarse salt, let sit 12-24 hours in cool place

Rinse thoroughly and pat dry with clean cloth

Smoke over low heat (150°F) for 8-12 hours until dry and leathery

Alternatively: Air dry in direct sunlight for 2-3 days (turn regularly)

Yield loss: 60-65% weight reduction (water evaporates)

575 lbs raw meat → about 215 lbs of jerky

Result: ~215 lbs of owlbear jerky

Shelf life: 1 year if stored in dry environment (50°F or below)

Value: 5 silver per pound = about 107 gold total

Texture: Tough and chewy. Best softened by soaking in water or wine for 30 minutes before eating.

Field Dressing (Do This in the First 2 Hours)
If you're processing an owlbear in the field (or more likely, if adventurers are processing it before they drag it to you), here's the checklist:

Critical Timeframe
Complete within 2 hours of death to prevent spoilage and economic loss.

Step-by-Step Procedure
☐ Within 15 minutes of death:

Bleed it (cut the throat or major artery)

Hang by back legs if possible to facilitate drainage

Allow 20-30 minutes for complete drainage

☐ Within 30 minutes:

Get the magical organs out (heart, liver, eyes, gall bladder)

These degrade rapidly and lose alchemical potency

Preserve immediately in alcohol, salt brine, or ice

☐ Within 1 hour (BEFORE cutting hindquarters):

Find and remove the musk gland

Mark location with chalk

Excise in 3-inch radius

Discard safely away from processing area

☐ Within 2 hours:

Gut it (remove stomach, intestines, all the nasty stuff)

Make careful incision from sternum to pelvis

Avoid puncturing intestines

Save kidneys if desired (edible but acquired taste)

☐ Also within 2 hours:

Check the gizzard for treasure

Cut it open, sift through contents

Potential for valuable finds!

☐ Within 4 hours (critical):

Get it below 40°F somehow

Use ice, cold water (Create Water spell + ice), or cold cellar

In hot weather, this step is CRITICAL

☐ Optional (if transporting long distance):

Remove the hide (saves 115 pounds of carry weight)

Quarter it (separate legs and torso for easier packing)

Transport Weight Estimates
Full carcass (undressed): 1,420 lbs (requires wagon or 4-5 pack horses)

Field dressed (organs removed): 1,205 lbs

Field dressed + hide removed: 1,090 lbs

Quartered (legs separated): Easier to pack, same weight

Time Estimates
4 skilled workers: 45-60 minutes for complete field dressing

4 unskilled workers: 2-3 hours (and they'll probably ruin some meat)

Recommendation: Hire a professional if you're not sure. It's worth the 35 gold.

Summary of Ways to Screw Up (And How Much They Cost)
Mistake	Loss
Puncture musk gland	50-150 gp
Let meat spoil (didn't keep cold)	100-400 gp
Ruin hide with knife marks	50-75 gp
Miss the arcane organs (not harvested fresh)	20 gp
Don't check gizzard for treasure	5-500 gp (potential)
Overcook the avian cuts (customer complaints)	Reputation damage
Sell spoiled meat	Guild revocation + lawsuit

Don't be that guy. Pay attention, work carefully, and you'll be fine.

Chapter 6: The Money
What This Is All Worth
Alright, let's talk gold. This is what you actually care about.

TOTAL COSTS	102 gp, 5 sp, 9 cp	

Export to Sheets

That's 30 gold more than guild pricing. The guild pays for itself after 2-3 owlbears.

Net Profit
Scenario	Gross Revenue	Operating Cost	Net Profit	Margin
Guild member (keep tenderloin)	813 gp	72 gp, 9 sp, 6 cp	740 gp, 4 cp	91%
Guild member (sell tenderloin)	861 gp	72 gp, 9 sp, 6 cp	788 gp, 4 cp	91%
Independent (keep tenderloin)	813 gp	102 gp, 5 sp, 9 cp	710 gp, 4 sp, 1 cp	87%
Independent (sell tenderloin)	861 gp	102 gp, 5 sp, 9 cp	758 gp, 4 sp, 1 cp	88%

Export to Sheets

That's an 87-91% profit margin. You won't find that on beef.

Additional Costs to Consider
If You Use Guild Facilities
The guild takes a 5% commission

Knock off about 42 gold from your profit

You end up with 698-746 gold net

But you get access to cold storage, smoking sheds, and equipment

If You're Independent
You keep all the profit

But you had to invest in your own shop (knives, tables, cold storage, smoking shed)

Initial investment: 500-1,000 gold for a basic setup

Worth it if you process 10+ large animals per year

If Adventurers Brought You the Carcass
You might pay them 100-200 gold for it (they did the dangerous part)

Reduces your profit to 540-700 gold

Still very profitable for you, good deal for them

Comparison to Common Livestock
For context, here's how owlbear compares to regular animals:

Animal	Live Weight	Dressed Weight	Retail Value	Profit	Processing Time
Owlbear	~1,600 lbs	1,420 lbs	861 gp	741-789 gp	14 hours
Cow	1,200 lbs	750 lbs	180 gp	140 gp	8 hours
Pig	250 lbs	180 lbs	45 gp	30 gp	3 hours
Deer	180 lbs	90 lbs	25 gp	18 gp	2 hours

Export to Sheets

Owlbear advantages:

5.3× more profitable than cow

25× more profitable than pig

42× more profitable than deer

Premium exotic meat commands higher prices

External materials (hide, feathers, arcane organs) add significant value

Owlbear disadvantages:

Extremely dangerous to hunt (requires experienced adventurers)

Unpredictable supply (can't farm them)

Requires substantial processing expertise (not for beginners)

Storage challenges due to large volume (need big cold cellar)

Longer processing time

Pricing Strategy Notes
Premium Cuts (Owlbear Filet, Grizzly T-Bone, Ribeye)
Price these 4-6× higher than common cuts

Rich nobles and adventurers will pay top gold

These are status symbols as much as food

Common Cuts (Shanks, Leg Steaks)
Price competitively for taverns and working-class customers

High volume, lower margin

Builds customer base

Specialty Items (Green Bacon, Bone Stock)
Premium pricing - these are unique products

Bacon: 10 gold per 10-lb slab is fair (1 gp/lb)

Stock: 5 gold per quart is standard for restorative stock

Sausage
Bulk sale (1 gp/lb) is easiest

Individual links (5 sp each) requires more labor but 33% more revenue

Most butchers go bulk unless they have apprentices with time

Seasonal Pricing Adjustments
Winter (high demand for preserved meats)
Bacon: +20% (12 gp per slab instead of 10 gp)

Sausage: +10% (1.1 gp/lb bulk)

Jerky: +25% (premium for long-storage food)

Summer (lower demand, harder to keep cold)
Fresh cuts: -10% (need to move them faster)

Rendered tallow: +20% (used for candle-making, demand increases)

During Sieges or Food Shortages
All prices: +50-100% (supply and demand)

Prioritize locals over price gouging (bad for reputation)

After Major Monster Hunts (market flooded)
Prices drop 20-30% if multiple owlbears hit market at once

Store what you can, make jerky from the rest

Regional Pricing Variations
Frontier Towns (remote, scarce supply)
Pay 150-200% of listed prices

Desperate for fresh meat

Transportation costs justified

Major Cities (Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter)
Pay 70-85% of listed prices

Regular supply from monster hunter guilds

Competitive market

Rural Villages (subsistence economy)
Pay 50-60% of listed prices

Can't afford premium cuts

Stick to cheap cuts and sausage

Adjust accordingly based on your location.

What Adventurers Should Charge You
If a party brings you an owlbear carcass, here's fair compensation:

Field Dressed (guts removed, still has hide)
150-200 gold is fair

They did the dangerous part and saved you some work

Fully Processed in Field (hide off, quartered)
100-150 gold

Less weight to transport but you miss the hide value

Just the Carcass (not field dressed)
100 gold

You're taking on more spoilage risk

With Damaged Musk Gland (50+ lbs of meat ruined)
50-80 gold

Significantly less value

Most adventurers don't know the value of what they've got. If they bring you an owlbear and ask "what'll you give us for it?", 150 gold is a fair offer that makes everyone happy.

If they're savvy and know the numbers, negotiate up to 200 gold. Still leaves you 500+ gold profit.

Break-Even Analysis
Minimum you need to make it worth your time:

Labor (you + 3 apprentices for 14 hours): 56 gp

Materials (salt, spices, wood, casings, aromatics): 14 gp

Overhead (ice, supplies, facility use): 10 gp

Minimum cost: 80 gp

If you're making less than 200 gold total revenue, you're losing money (or barely breaking even). Don't process damaged or spoiled owlbears unless the customer is paying a premium for your time.

The Tenderloin Tradition
Every butcher keeps the tenderloin. This isn't greed - it's tradition.

Why the tradition exists:

You did the skilled work

It's the best cut on the whole animal

It's a mark of respect for the craft

Keeps morale up (butchering is hard work)

What it's worth:

2 roasts × 24 gp = 48 gold

Or 2 incredible meals for you and your family

What you should do:

Keep it

Cook it at home

Share it with your crew

Remember why you do this job

If someone insists you sell the tenderloin, charge them 30 gold per roast (premium over standard price) and tell them it's not for sale.

Anyone who doesn't respect the tenderloin tradition isn't someone you want as a customer.

Final Economics Summary
Best case scenario (everything goes right):

Gross revenue: 861 gp

Operating costs: 72 gp, 9 sp, 6 cp (guild member)

Net profit: 788 gp, 4 cp

Time invested: 14 hours (2 days)

Hourly rate: 56 gp per hour

Realistic scenario (you keep tenderloin, guild member):

Gross revenue: 813 gp

Operating costs: 72 gp, 9 sp, 6 cp

Net profit: 740 gp, 4 cp

Still excellent

Worst case scenario (musk gland punctured, some spoilage):

Gross revenue: 670 gp (reduced)

Operating costs: 72 gp, 9 sp, 6 cp

Net profit: 597 gp, 4 cp

Still profitable, but frustrating

The point: Even when things go wrong, owlbears are wildly profitable. Just don't puncture the musk gland.

May your blades stay sharp and your cellars stay cold.
