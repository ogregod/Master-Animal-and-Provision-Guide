## BLINK WOLF GUIDE FIXES

### 1. ✅ Black Peppercorns Pricing - CORRECTED

**BEFORE (WRONG):**
- "Black pepper: 2 oz (1 gp)"

**AFTER (CORRECT - matches Provisions Guide):**
- "Black pepper: 2 oz (5 cp)"

**Explanation:** Provisions Guide lists Black Peppercorns at 1 sp per 0.25 lbs (4 oz) with 48 uses. For 2 oz, the correct price is 5 cp (half of 1 sp).

**Impact:** Reduced spice cost from **2 gp, 5 sp, 11 cp** to **1 gp, 6 sp, 6 cp** (savings of 9 sp, 5 cp per 100 lbs)

---

### 2. ✅ Scaled Spice Cost for 136 lbs - RECALCULATED

**BEFORE:**
- "For 136 lbs of sausage, scale up: **3.4 gold in spices**"

**AFTER:**
- "For 136 lbs of sausage, scale up: **2.3 gold in spices**"

**Impact:** Savings of 1.1 gold on sausage production

---

### 3. ✅ Sausage Production Costs - RECALCULATED

- Guild: 84.1% (was 84%)

---

### 7. ✅ CRITICAL FIX: Retail Cuts Math Discrepancy - RESOLVED

**THE PROBLEM:**
- The guide contradicted itself:
  - Line 224 said: "220 lbs of retail cuts"
  - Weight accountability table said: "320 lbs of retail cuts"
  - Detailed primal breakdown totaled: 320 lbs

**THE ROOT CAUSE:**
- The 320 lbs represents the total USABLE MEAT from all primals
- But only 220 lbs is actually sold as RETAIL cuts (steaks, roasts, chops)
- The remaining 100 lbs goes to trim (95 lbs) and stew meat (25 lbs)

**THE FIX:**
1. **Clarified the Retail Cuts Summary table** to show both "Usable Meat" and "Sold as Retail Cuts" columns
2. **Updated the Weight Accountability table** to show:
   - Retail cuts: **220 lbs** (was 320 lbs)
   - Sausage trim: 95 lbs
   - Stew meat/scraps: 25 lbs
   - Waste: **150 lbs** (was 50 lbs - includes connective tissue and tougher sections from primals)
3. **Added explanatory note** clarifying that prime portions become retail cuts, tougher sections become trim

**VERIFICATION AGAINST GENERAL BUTCHER GUIDE:**
- Canine yield standard: 35% retail meat
- 35% × 645 lbs carcass = **225.75 lbs**
- Guide now shows **220 lbs** ✓ **MATCHES** (within expected variation)
