The Master Butcher’s Universal Standards
Standardizing the Craft from Waterdeep to Neverwinter
Written by: The Joint Oversight Committee, Butchers’ Guilds of the Sword Coast Purpose: To eliminate inconsistency in processing magical and mundane carcasses.

Listen up. Whether you are hacking through an Owlbear in Waterdeep or a Blink Wolf in Neverwinter, the math doesn't change. We’ve seen too many apprentices ruin good meat or miscalculate their margins because they’re following two different sets of rules. This document sets the firm standard for labor, yields, and processing.

If it’s dead and on your table, this is how you account for it.

I. Standardized Labor & Guild Rates
Processing a 1,400-pound chimera is not the same as a 200-pound hog. Use these rates to calculate your crew costs fairly.

Hourly Wages
Role	Independent Rate	Guild Rate
Master Butcher	2.5 gp / hr	3.5 gp / hr
Journeyman	1.5 gp / hr	2.0 gp / hr
Apprentice / Laborer	0.5 gp / hr	0.8 gp / hr

Guild Overhead
Guild Commission: 5% of gross revenue for using guild halls and cold storage.

Facility Rental (Independent): 10–25 gp flat fee per carcass depending on size.

II. Yield Standards by Animal Type
These percentages are applied to the Dressed Weight (the weight of the carcass once it arrives at the shop, already bled out).

Animal Type	Retail Meat	Sausage Trim	Stew/Secondary	Bones	Fat (Tallow)	Processing Loss	Waste	Total
Canine (Wolf/Blink Wolf)	35%	13%	4%	15%	6%	5%	7%	85%
Bear (Ursine/Owlbear Half)	40%	10%	7%	12%	12%	6%	5%	92%
Bird (Avian/Owlbear Half)	32%	8%	10%	15%	2%	8%	8%	83%
Bovine (Cattle)	42%	10%	6%	10%	10%	5%	5%	88%
Hog (Swine/Pig)	38%	12%	8%	8%	15%	6%	4%	91%

Note on Categories:
• Retail Meat: Premium cuts sold as steaks, roasts, and chops
• Sausage Trim: Lean scraps ground for sausage and forcemeats
• Stew/Secondary: Tougher cuts sold as stew meat, soup bones with meat, or budget cuts
• Bones: Skeletal structure used for stock, glace, and bone meal
• Fat (Tallow): Rendered into cooking fat, soap, candles, and leather treatment
• Processing Loss: Moisture evaporation, trimming waste, and unavoidable material loss during butchering
• Waste: Silver skin, damaged tissue, non-magical organs (lungs, spleen), and inedible connective tissue

Note on Total Percentages: These percentages sum to 83-92% of dressed weight. The remaining 8-17% represents:
• External materials (hide, pelt, feathers, trophies): 8-13% of dressed weight (processed separately)
• Blood (already drained during field dressing): NOT included in dressed weight
• Digestive tract contents (removed during field dressing): NOT included in dressed weight

Complete Carcass Accounting:
100% Live Weight = Blood (8%) + Viscera (9%) + Dressed Weight (83%)
100% Dressed Weight = External Materials (10%) + Usable Carcass (90%)
100% Usable Carcass = Retail (35-42%) + Trim (10-13%) + Stew (4-10%) + Bones (10-15%) + Fat (6-15%) + Loss (5-8%) + Waste (4-8%)

III. The Art of the Scraps
Hunter’s Sausage & Internal Fat
Every pound of sausage should, whenever possible, be self-sustaining.

The Ratio: 60%–70% lean trim to 30%–40% animal fat.

Fat Sourcing: Always pull from the belly and flank first. Leaner animals (Birds/Canines) often require the "Butcher’s Credit"—using fat reserved from a Bear or Hog processed earlier in the week.

Casings: 3 gp for natural hog or sheep casings to process a large (800lb+) carcass.

Rendered Tallow (The Liquid Gold)
Fat trimmings are useless until rendered.

Preparation: Dice fat into 1-inch cubes. Smaller pieces melt evenly; large chunks burn on the outside while staying raw inside.

The Render: Simmer on low heat (200°F–250°F) for 6–8 hours.

Clarification: Strain through linen into jars.

Yield: Expect a 10% weight loss from evaporation and solids.

Bulk Value: 2 silver per lb.

Clarified/Jarred: 5 silver per lb.

Salt Pricing & Usage
Do not underestimate salt costs. It's cheap per pound but you need a lot of it.

Standard Pricing (per 99_tables):
• Sea salt (general use): 3 copper per pound
• Curing salt (preservation): 4 copper per pound

Typical Usage by Carcass Size:
• Small game (200-400 lbs): 10-15 lbs total (pelt curing, minor preservation)
• Medium game (800-1,200 lbs): 15-25 lbs total (pelt curing, organ preservation, sausage seasoning)
• Large game (1,400-2,000 lbs): 25-40 lbs total (hide curing, organ preservation, bacon curing, sausage)
• Alpha specimens (4,000-6,000 lbs): 80-120 lbs total (massive hide, organs, extensive preservation)

Curing Ratios:
• Dry cure bacon/meat: 2.5% salt by weight (10 lbs meat = 0.25 lbs salt)
• Pelt/hide preservation: ~10% salt by weight of hide
• Organ preservation: 100% salt coverage (1:1 ratio for packing)

Bone Glace (Concentrated Restoration)
Do not sell watery stock. We sell Glace.

The Roast: Roast premium bones (femurs, knuckles, vertebrae) at 425°F until deep brown.

The Simmer: Submerge in water and simmer for 24–36 hours.

The Reduction: Strain and boil the liquid down by half until it coats the back of a spoon.

Standard Stock: 3.5 silver per pint.

Master’s Glace: 5 gold per quart (2.5 gp per pint).

IV. Universal Order of Operations
To ensure no gold is lost to spoilage or clumsiness, follow this sequence every time:

Arcane Viscera: Harvest magical organs (Heart, Liver, Eyes, Nodes, Sacs) within 30 minutes of arrival. Potency equals profit.

External Materials: Strip the hide, feathers, and trophies (Beaks, Talons, Fangs).

The Breakdown: Quarter the carcass and separate the retail cuts (Filets, Steaks, Roasts).

Trim & Sort: Move lean scraps to the sausage grinder and bones to the roasting pans.

Rendering & Reduction: Start the tallow and stock pots last; they work while you sleep.

The Tenderloin Tradition: The Master Butcher always keeps the tenderloin for personal use. It is the silent tax for the skill required to keep the shop running.

V. Dressed Weight Definition

Dressed Weight is the weight of the carcass that arrives at the butcher's shop, measured immediately upon receipt.

Field dressing (performed by hunter before transport):
• Blood is drained (8% of live weight)
• Major viscera removed (digestive tract, lungs, non-magical organs)
• Hide/pelt typically REMAINS on the carcass during transport
• Magical organs (heart, liver, eyes, sacs, nodes) are carefully preserved and transported separately

Shop dressing (performed by butcher):
• Hide/pelt is removed and processed
• Carcass is quartered and broken down into primals
• Remaining organs are processed or discarded
• Magical organs are cleaned and prepared for sale

Standard Calculation:
Live Weight × 0.92 (8% blood loss) × 0.90 (10% viscera loss) = Dressed Weight ≈ 83% of live weight

Example:
1,000 lb live weight → 920 lbs (after blood) → 828 lbs (after viscera) ≈ 830 lbs dressed weight

All yield percentages in this guide are calculated based on DRESSED WEIGHT unless otherwise specified.
