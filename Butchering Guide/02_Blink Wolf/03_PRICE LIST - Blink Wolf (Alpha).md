## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS

⚠️ **BLINK NODE IS EXTREMELY FRAGILE** - Rupture = loss of 800 gp
⚠️ **FROST SAC IS VOLATILE** - Must be kept cold, handle with care
⚠️ **Wolf meat is VERY GAMEY** - Requires proper seasoning and marinating
⚠️ **DO NOT OVERCOOK lean cuts** - Ruins texture, makes meat tough
⚠️ **Use 60/40 fat ratio for sausage** - Standard for gamey meat per General Butcher Guide
⚠️ **Alpha wolves require 6 skilled workers** - Not a solo job
⚠️ **Preservation supplies required** - 100 gp additional cost for salt and ice
⚠️ **Organ harvest must be within 30 minutes of kill** - Or value drops significantly
⚠️ **You need a WAREHOUSE** - Cannot process in normal butcher shop

---

## 💼 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Workspace Requirements
You CANNOT process an Alpha Blink Wolf in a normal butcher shop. You need:
- Warehouse-sized facility
- Industrial hoists and pulleys
- Oversized tables and cutting surfaces
- Multiple walk-in coolers/freezers
- Specialized containers for watermelon-sized organs

### Fair Purchase Price
Most parties that can kill an Alpha know what they've got. Expect to negotiate hard.

**Fair price range:** 1,200-1,500 gp for a well-preserved carcass
