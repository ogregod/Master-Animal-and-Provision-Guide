# The Master Butcher's Guide
## Volume II: The Blink Wolf (The Vanishing Menace)

**Written by:** Mira Wolfheart, Master Butcher  
**For:** Anyone brave enough to hunt these damned teleporting ice-breathers  
**Date:** After 25 years processing wolves and about 34 Blink Wolves

---

Listen up. I've been butchering wolves—regular, dire, winter, and yes, these magical bastards—since before most of you picked up a knife. Blink Wolves are not your average canine. They're bigger, meaner, and they have organs inside them that can ruin your entire day if you nick them wrong.

This isn't a deer. This isn't even a dire wolf. This is an 800-pound magical predator with a frost sac that'll freeze your best cuts solid and a blink node that'll scatter meat across three different planes of existence if you're careless.

But here's the thing: if you do it right, you're walking away with 450-500 gold from a normal Blink Wolf, and upward of 3,000 gold from an Alpha. The meat's not going to win any culinary awards—it's wolf, not owlbear—but the pelt is worth its weight in gold, and those magic organs? Alchemists will pay through the nose for fresh ones.

So sit down, pay attention, and for the gods' sake, READ THE WARNINGS before you start cutting.

## What You're Looking At

When adventurers drag an 800-pound Blink Wolf to your shop (and they better have bled it out already), you've got about 736 pounds of dressed weight to work with. That's assuming they did their job in the field and you're not dealing with 64 pounds of frozen blood and a ruined carcass.

Understanding "Dressed Weight"
The 736 pounds is the dressed weight - meaning the carcass after field dressing. This removes:
• Blood: 64 lbs (8% of live weight, drained in field)
• Live weight before field dressing: 800 lbs total

So when you see "736 lbs dressed weight," that's what actually arrives at your shop, ready to butcher.

**The breakdown you need to know:**

- **External materials** (pelt, organs, trophies): 100 lbs → 420 gold
- **Retail cuts** (steaks, roasts, chops): 220 lbs → 233.5 gold
- **Sausage from trim**: 138 lbs (84 lbs trim + 56 lbs pork fat, 60/40 ratio for gamey meat) → 82.8 gold gross / 63 gold net
- **Bone stock**: 97 lbs bones → 36.4 gold
- **Rendered tallow**: 35 lbs (from 39 lbs raw) → 7 gold
- **Total value**: 814.7 gold (detailed calculations)

**Processing time:** About 10 hours with a crew of 3 skilled workers.

**Operating costs:** 101.8 gold for labor, materials, overhead (independent).

**Your profit:** 712.9 gold for a day and a half of work (independent butcher).

That's damn good money for an animal whose meat tastes like you're chewing on a boot that spent a week in a freezer. The profit is ALL about doing this right—one mistake with those organs and you've just turned 200 gold of meat into frozen garbage or interdimensional scrap.

## How to Use This Guide

This guide follows the same structure as Volume I (the Owlbear guide). If you've read that, you know the drill:

1. **External materials** - Pelt, organs, and trophies (harvest FIRST)
2. **Anatomy** - Understanding canine structure and wolf meat
3. **Processing** - Breaking down the carcass into sellable cuts
4. **Scraps** - Sausage, stock, and tallow from what's left
5. **Accounting** - Where every pound goes (complete breakdown)
6. **Warnings** - The Frost Sac and Blink Node (DO NOT SCREW THESE UP)
7. **Economics** - What it's all worth and what you take home
8. **Alpha Blink Wolf** - Scaling up to 5,200-pound monsters

Read the warnings section BEFORE you start. I'm not kidding. The Blink Node alone can cost you 150 gold if you puncture it, and the Frost Sac can freeze 30+ pounds of premium meat into worthless ice-damaged tissue.

# Chapter 1: The Field Harvest (External Materials)
## The Stuff That Pays Your Rent

Before you touch the meat—BEFORE—you strip off everything valuable. This is where you make your actual money with Blink Wolves, because let's be honest: the meat is edible, but it's not exactly premium dining.

You should make about **420 gold** from external materials alone. That's more than half your revenue from a creature whose meat is, charitably speaking, "an acquired taste."

### The Pelt (85 lbs)

This is the FIRST thing you remove, and it's the most valuable single item on a Blink Wolf. An 800-pound wolf has a pelt the size of a good-sized rug, and it's THICK. We're talking 2-3 inches of dense winter fur that'll keep you warm in a blizzard at 10 below zero.

**What it's worth:** 200 gold to a furrier, raw and untreated. If you process it yourself (salting, scraping, drying—about 2 days of work), you can get 250 gold, but most of us don't have time for that.

**Why it's so valuable:**
- Size: A normal wolf pelt is maybe 15-20 pounds. This is 85 pounds of pure insulation.
- Warmth: Blink Wolves live in frozen wastes and magical tundras. This fur will keep you alive in conditions that kill normal people.
- Durability: Wolf fur is tough as hell. This pelt will last 20+ years with proper care.

**How to remove it:** 
Start at the rear legs, work your way forward. Sharp knife, smooth cuts, NO HOLES. Every puncture drops the value by 10-20 gold. The pelt comes off easiest if the carcass is fresh—wait more than 4 hours and you'll be fighting rigor mortis.

**What to look for:**
- Minimal combat damage (arrow holes, claw marks, burn marks)
- Clean kill (throat or heart—head shots damage the valuable shoulder area)
- No frostbite damage from the wolf's own Frost Sac leaking (yes, it happens)

**Storage:** Roll it fur-side-in, salt it heavily if you can't sell immediately. Keep it COLD and DRY. Wet wolf fur smells like death and mildew had a baby.

**Personal note:** I once had an adventuring party bring me a Blink Wolf they'd killed with a fireball. The pelt looked like someone had used it for target practice with a siege weapon. Got 60 gold instead of 200. They were not happy. Neither was I.

### Arcane Viscera - HARVEST THESE IMMEDIATELY (7 lbs total)

Okay, this is CRITICAL. The moment that wolf stops breathing, you have maybe 30 minutes before these organs start degrading. Magical organs lose potency FAST when the creature dies. You need to move.

**Priority harvest order:**

#### 1. The Blink Node (3 lbs)

This is a crystalline organ located just behind the heart, nestled between the lungs. It looks like a chunk of pale blue ice shot through with silver veins, and it pulses with residual magic even after death.

**What it does:** This is what lets Blink Wolves teleport. Alchemists use it for Potions of Dimension Door, Misty Step scrolls, and emergency teleportation items.

**What it's worth:** 100 gold if harvested within 30 minutes. 50 gold if you're slow. 10 gold if it's been more than 2 hours.

**CRITICAL WARNING - READ THIS:**
If you puncture the Blink Node, it releases a chaotic teleportation burst. Anything within 2 feet gets scattered across random locations within 100 feet. I've seen butchers lose entire shoulders of meat because they got careless and the meat just... vanished. Reappeared in the rafters, outside in the street, inside a barrel of salt. Useless.

**How to extract it:**
- Cut through the ribcage from the side (NOT through the sternum)
- Reach in, feel for the hard crystalline mass behind the heart
- Cut the connective tissue CAREFULLY—it's attached to major blood vessels
- Lift it out in one smooth motion
- Drop it immediately into a jar of pure alcohol (not ale, PURE spirits—alchemist-grade)

If you hear a high-pitched humming sound, you've damaged it. Get it in alcohol FAST or you're about to have a very interesting day.

#### 2. The Frost Sac (4 lbs)

Located in the throat, just above where the esophagus meets the stomach. It's a fleshy sac about the size of your fist (on a normal Blink Wolf), filled with an icy-blue viscous fluid that's cold enough to give you frostbite if you're not wearing gloves.

**What it does:** This is the cold-breath weapon organ. The fluid inside is used for Potions of Cold Resistance, ice-based alchemy, and preservation magic.

**What it's worth:** 125 gold fresh (within 1 hour). 60 gold if you take your time. 20 gold if it's old.

**CRITICAL WARNING - READ THIS TOO:**
If you puncture the Frost Sac, the fluid inside flash-freezes everything it touches. Meat, bone, tools, YOUR HANDS. I watched an apprentice nick one once. The fluid leaked out, froze a 30-pound shoulder solid in about ten seconds, and rendered it completely unsellable—the tissue crystallized and turned to mush when it thawed.

**How to extract it:**
- Approach from the throat opening (where you'd gut a normal animal)
- Cut down alongside the esophagus from the inside
- You'll see the sac—it's darker blue than the surrounding tissue and COLD to the touch
- Cut the connecting tissue at the TOP first (furthest from the stomach)
- Gently lift it free, supporting the bottom so the weight doesn't tear it open
- Place it in a padded container lined with wool or thick cloth
- DO NOT jar it in alcohol like the Blink Node—the cold fluid will crack glass
- Store it in an insulated box until you can sell it

**Identification tip:** If you see your breath when you get close to the throat cavity, you've found the Frost Sac.

#### Preservation Summary

| Organ | Weight | Harvest Window | Storage Method | Fresh Value |
|-------|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Blink Node | 3 lbs | 30 minutes | Jar of pure alcohol | 100 gp |
| Frost Sac | 4 lbs | 60 minutes | Insulated padded container | 125 gp |
| **TOTAL** | **7 lbs** | **ASAP** | **Separate** | **225 gp** |

Harvest these FIRST. Before the pelt, before anything else. You can always skin a carcass later. You can't un-degrade magical organs.

### Trophy Parts (8 lbs)

Blink Wolves don't have a lot of trophy value compared to owlbears, but there's still a market for the parts.

#### The Fangs (2 lbs total)

Four major fangs: two upper canines, two lower. Each one is 3-4 inches long, curved, and sharp as hell.

**What people use them for:**
- Dagger pommels and hilts
- Necklaces and jewelry (popular with rangers and druids)
- "Lucky charms" for hunters
- Ground into powder for dubious folk remedies

**How to extract:** Cut at the gumline with a sharp knife or use pliers. DON'T just yank them—you'll shatter the root and cut the value in half.

**What they're worth:** 15 gold for all four in good condition. 8 gold if they're cracked or damaged.

#### The Claws (3 lbs total)

Four paws, four claws per paw, 16 total. They're smaller than owlbear talons but still decent-sized—about 2 inches long, black, and hooked.

**Market:** Leatherworkers, jewelers, hedge wizards who think they do something magical (they don't).

**How to extract:** Cut at the base of each claw where it meets the bone. If the adventurers already took the paws off, just remove the claws from the severed paws.

**What they're worth:** 8 gold for the full set. 4 gold if some are missing or broken.

#### The Eyes (negligible weight)

Yeah, people buy these. I don't understand it either.

Blink Wolves have pale blue eyes with silver flecks. Some people claim they can see into the Ethereal Plane if you preserve them right (they can't). Others just think they look cool in a jar.

**How to extract:** Scoop them out with a spoon. Try not to rupture them.

**What they're worth:** 2 gold for the pair if intact. Worthless if damaged.

#### The Tail (3 lbs)

Long, bushy, dramatic. Some people mount them on walls, others use the fur for trim on cloaks and hoods.

**How to remove:** Cut at the base of the spine. The tail comes off in one piece if you do it right.

**What it's worth:** 5 gold if the fur is in good condition. 2 gold if it's mangy or damaged.

### External Materials Summary

| Component | Weight | Market Price |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Pelt | 85 lbs | 200 gp |
| Blink Node | 3 lbs | 100 gp |
| Frost Sac | 4 lbs | 125 gp |
| Fangs | 2 lbs | 15 gp |
| Claws | 3 lbs | 8 gp |
| Eyes | ~0 lbs | 2 gp |
| Tail | 3 lbs | 5 gp |
| **TOTAL** | **100 lbs** | **455 gp** |

*(Note: This is GROSS value. You'll spend about 35 gp on preservation supplies—jars, alcohol, containers, ice—so your NET is around 420 gp from externals.)*

# Chapter 2: Breaking Down the Wolf
## Understanding Canine Anatomy and Wolf Meat Quality

Alright, the valuable bits are harvested. Now we deal with the actual meat.

If you're used to processing deer, pigs, or cattle, wolf anatomy is going to feel familiar but WRONG. Canines are built for running and tearing, not for carrying fat or developing marbling. The meat is lean, dense, and tough. It's not BAD, but it's not GOOD either.

You've got about **636 pounds of carcass** to work with after removing the external materials (100 lbs from 736 lbs dressed weight). Of that, you'll get:

- 220 lbs of retail cuts (steaks, roasts, chops)
- 84 lbs of trim for sausage
- 25 lbs of stew meat/scraps
- 97 lbs of bones (for stock)
- 39 lbs of fat (for tallow)
- The rest is waste (connective tissue, organs you can't use, processing loss)

### The Primal Cuts of a Blink Wolf

Wolves have the same general layout as dogs, just scaled WAY up. Here's what you're working with:

#### 1. The Shoulder (Front Quarter)

**Weight:** About 55 lbs of usable meat per shoulder (110 lbs total from both sides).

**What it's good for:**
- Roasts (tough, needs slow cooking)
- Stew meat (the go-to use for wolf shoulder)
- Ground meat for sausage

**Why it's tough:** This is the "engine" of a wolf. They use their front legs for everything—running, jumping, tearing prey apart. The muscles are dense and full of connective tissue.

**How to sell it:**
- **Shoulder roast:** 3-4 lb chunks → 6 silver per pound
- **Stew meat:** 1-2 lb packages → 5 silver per pound

**Market reality:** Most customers won't buy wolf shoulder as steaks. It's too tough. If they want wolf meat at all, they're buying it for stews, braises, or pies where the long cooking breaks down the tissue.

**Revised shoulder pricing:**
- 55 lbs per shoulder × 2 shoulders = 110 lbs total
- Sold at ~8 sp/lb average = **~88 gp total** (both shoulders)

| Cut | Weight | Price/lb | Total Value |
|-----|--------|----------|-------------|
| Shoulder Roasts | 70 lbs | 6 sp | 42 gp |
| Stew Meat | 40 lbs | 5 sp | 20 gp |
| **TOTAL** | **110 lbs** | **~8 sp avg** | **62 gp** |

#### 2. The Loin and Saddle (Back)

**Weight:** About 85 lbs total (this is the ENTIRE back section from shoulder to hip).

**What it's good for:**
- The closest thing to "premium" wolf meat
- Chops and small steaks
- Roasts if you're feeling optimistic

**Why it's better:** Less worked than the legs, more tender (relatively speaking). This is where you'll find any marbling at all, though don't expect much.

**How to sell it:**
- **Loin chops:** 8-12 oz portions → 1 gold per pound
- **Saddle roast:** 3-5 lb pieces → 9 silver per pound
- **Backstrap steaks:** 10-14 oz cuts → 1.2 gold per pound

**Market reality:** This is your "premium" wolf meat. It's STILL not as good as beef or owlbear, but it's the best the wolf has to offer.

**Revised loin/saddle pricing:**
- 85 lbs total
- Sold at ~1 gp/lb average = **~85 gp total**

| Cut | Weight | Price/lb | Total Value |
|-----|--------|----------|-------------|
| Backstrap Steaks | 20 lbs | 1.2 gp | 24 gp |
| Loin Chops | 40 lbs | 1 gp | 40 gp |
| Saddle Roasts | 25 lbs | 9 sp | 22.5 gp |
| **TOTAL** | **85 lbs** | **~1 gp avg** | **86.5 gp** |

#### 3. The Hindquarters (Rear Legs)

**Weight:** About 50 lbs per leg (100 lbs total from both sides).

**What it's good for:**
- Roasts (the primary use)
- Steaks (if you cut them thin and tenderize them)
- Stew meat from the lower leg

**Why it's tough:** Like the shoulders, these are working muscles. Wolves run, leap, and climb with their back legs. Expect dense, chewy meat.

**How to sell it:**
- **Leg roasts:** 4-6 lb pieces → 7 silver per pound
- **Thin-cut steaks:** 8 oz portions → 8 silver per pound

**Market reality:** The hindquarters are tougher than the loin but not as bad as the shoulders. You can sell them as roasts or steaks, but customers need to know they're not getting prime cuts.

**Revised hindquarter pricing:**
- 50 lbs per leg × 2 legs = 100 lbs total
- Sold at ~7.5 sp/lb average = **~75 gp total**

| Cut | Weight | Price/lb | Total Value |
|-----|--------|----------|-------------|
| Leg Roasts | 70 lbs | 7 sp | 49 gp |
| Thin Steaks | 30 lbs | 8 sp | 24 gp |
| **TOTAL** | **100 lbs** | **~7.5 sp avg** | **73 gp** |

#### 4. The Ribs and Belly

**Weight:** About 25 lbs total (this is after removing most of the ribcage for stock).

**What it's good for:**
- Spare ribs (braised or smoked)
- Belly strips (if you can find any fat)

**Why it's marginal:** Wolves don't carry much fat, so the belly isn't like pork belly. The ribs are small and bony compared to the body size.

**How to sell it:**
- **Spare rib racks:** 2-3 lb portions → 5 silver per pound
- **Belly strips:** 1 lb portions → 4 silver per pound

**Market reality:** These are your "budget" cuts. People buy them for flavor, not for quality.

**Rib/belly pricing:**
- 25 lbs total at 4-5 sp/lb average = **~12 gp total**

### Retail Cuts Summary

Here's the breakdown of PRIMAL sections and their retail value:

| Primal Section | Usable Meat | Sold as Retail Cuts | Trim/Stew | Average Price | Retail Value |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Shoulder (both) | 110 lbs | 70 lbs roasts | 40 lbs stew | ~8 sp/lb | 62 gp |
| Loin/Saddle | 85 lbs | 85 lbs steaks/chops | 0 lbs | ~1 gp/lb | 86.5 gp |
| Hindquarters (both) | 100 lbs | 100 lbs roasts/steaks | 0 lbs | ~7.3 sp/lb | 73 gp |
| Ribs/Belly | 25 lbs | 0 lbs | 25 lbs trim | ~5 sp/lb | 12 gp |
| **TOTALS** | **320 lbs** | **255 lbs retail** | **65 lbs trim/stew** | **~10.6 sp/lb avg** | **233.5 gp** |

**Understanding the breakdown:** Each primal section yields some prime retail cuts (sold as roasts/steaks) and some tougher sections (goes to trim for sausage or stew meat). The 255 lbs of retail cuts from primals (steaks, roasts, and shoulder stew meat) generates 233.5 gp in revenue. The remaining 65 lbs of trim/stew gets processed into sausage (25 lbs from ribs) and sold as additional stew meat (40 lbs from shoulder).

**Note on accounting categories:** For yield percentage tracking, "retail cuts" specifically refers to premium steaks and roasts (220 lbs), which matches the General Butcher Guide standard of 35% retail yield (220 ÷ 636 carcass weight = 34.6%). The 40 lbs of shoulder stew meat, while sold directly, is categorized separately as "stew meat/scraps" along with other budget cuts.

### What Wolf Meat Actually Tastes Like

Let's be honest: wolf meat is not delicious. It's edible, nutritious, and filling, but it's not going to win awards.

**Flavor profile:**
- Gamey (stronger than venison)
- Slightly metallic (carnivore diet)
- Lean and dry (very little fat)
- Tough if not cooked properly

**Best cooking methods:**
- **Braising:** Low and slow in liquid breaks down the connective tissue
- **Stewing:** Long simmering makes it tender
- **Smoking:** Adds flavor and helps mask the gamey taste
- **Grinding:** Mixing with pork fat makes decent sausage

**Worst cooking methods:**
- **Grilling steaks:** You'll be chewing for an hour
- **Roasting hot and fast:** Produces shoe leather
- **Pan-frying:** Unless it's pounded thin, forget it

### Pricing Strategy

You CANNOT sell wolf meat at beef prices. You CAN'T. I don't care how rare Blink Wolves are—the meat is still tough, gamey, and difficult to cook.

**Realistic pricing:**
- Budget cuts (shoulder, ribs): 4-6 sp/lb
- Standard cuts (hindquarters): 7-8 sp/lb
- Premium cuts (loin, backstrap): 9 sp - 1.2 gp/lb

If someone wants to pay MORE because it's "exotic magical wolf meat," take their money. But don't expect it.

### Customer Expectations

When you sell wolf meat, make sure your customers know what they're getting:

**Tell them:**
- "This is lean and tough—braise it or stew it."
- "It's got a strong flavor—use herbs and spices."
- "It's not beef. Adjust your expectations."

**Don't tell them:**
- "This is premium meat." (It's not.)
- "Cook it like a steak." (They'll hate you.)
- "It's as good as owlbear." (It's really not.)

Honest butchers get repeat customers. Lying butchers get angry mobs.

# Chapter 3: Processing the Carcass
## Step-by-Step Breakdown

Alright, you've got a 745-pound skinned, gutted, organ-free carcass hanging in your shop. Now comes the actual work.

### Tools You'll Need

- **Butcher's saw** (for bones and ribcage)
- **Boning knife** (sharp, flexible, 6-inch blade)
- **Cleaver** (for joints and heavy work)
- **Steel or sharpening stone** (you'll dull your blades FAST on wolf)
- **Large cutting table** (you'll need space)
- **Hooks and gambrels** (to hang sections while you work)
- **Buckets** (for trim, fat, bones)
- **Scale** (to track weight and pricing)

### Step 1: Quartering the Carcass

You can't work on an 800-pound animal in one piece. You need to break it down into manageable sections.

**The breakdown:**
1. **Remove the front legs** (shoulders) - saw through the scapula attachment
2. **Remove the rear legs** (hindquarters) - cut through the hip joint
3. **Separate the loin** from the ribcage - cut along the spine
4. **Remove the ribs and belly** - saw through the spine, separate the rib sections

You should now have:
- 2 front leg quarters (shoulders)
- 2 rear leg quarters (hindquarters)
- 1 loin/saddle section (the back)
- 1 rib/belly section
- The spine and neck (for stock)

### Step 2: Breaking Down the Shoulder

The shoulder is your BIGGEST section and the toughest to work with. It's a mess of bone, connective tissue, and lean muscle.

**Process:**
1. Remove the scapula (shoulder blade) - cut along the bone, scrape it clean
2. Separate the upper shoulder from the lower leg
3. Cut the meat into roasts (3-4 lb pieces) or stew chunks (1-2 inch cubes)
4. Trim off fat (minimal) and silverskin
5. Save ALL trim and fat for sausage

**Yield from one shoulder:**
- 25 lbs of roasts/steaks
- 20 lbs of stew meat
- 10 lbs of trim (sausage)
- 8 lbs of bone (stock)
- 2 lbs of fat (tallow)

Multiply by 2 for both shoulders.

### Step 3: Breaking Down the Loin

This is your "premium" section. Handle it with more care than the shoulders.

**Process:**
1. Locate the backstrap (the long muscle running along the spine)
2. Cut the backstrap free from the spine - smooth, careful cuts
3. Remove the tenderloin (if present - wolves don't have much)
4. Cut the backstrap into steaks or leave as a roast
5. Remove the loin chops by sawing through the spine in 1-inch sections
6. Trim off silverskin and minimal fat

**Yield from the loin:**
- 20 lbs of backstrap (steaks or roast)
- 40 lbs of loin chops
- 25 lbs of saddle roasts
- 5 lbs of trim (sausage)
- 15 lbs of spine bones (stock)

### Step 4: Breaking Down the Hindquarters

Similar process to the shoulders, but the leg bones are bigger and the meat is slightly more tender.

**Process:**
1. Remove the femur (thigh bone) - cut around it, scrape it clean
2. Separate the upper leg (thigh) from the lower leg (shank)
3. Cut the thigh into roasts or slice thin for steaks
4. Remove the shank meat (tough, but usable for stew or sausage)
5. Save all bones for stock

**Yield from one hindquarter:**
- 30 lbs of leg roasts
- 15 lbs of thin steaks
- 5 lbs of shank meat (stew or sausage)
- 10 lbs of bone (stock)

Multiply by 2 for both legs.

### Step 5: Ribs and Belly

Not much here, but waste nothing.

**Process:**
1. Separate the ribs from the belly
2. Cut rib racks into 2-3 lb portions
3. Trim belly meat into strips (if there's any fat, leave it on)
4. Save rib bones for stock

**Yield:**
- 15 lbs of spare ribs
- 10 lbs of belly meat
- 20 lbs of rib bones (stock)

### Step 6: Trim, Neck, and Scraps

Everything left over goes into one of three buckets:

1. **Sausage trim** (84 lbs) - any usable meat too small or tough for retail cuts
2. **Stew meat/scraps** (25 lbs) - odds and ends, neck meat, shank scraps
3. **Bone pile** (97 lbs) - for making stock
4. **Fat pile** (39 lbs) - for rendering into tallow

Nothing gets thrown away. NOTHING.

### Processing Time

With a crew of 3 experienced butchers:
- Quartering: 1 hour
- Shoulders: 1.5 hours
- Loin: 1 hour
- Hindquarters: 1.5 hours
- Ribs/belly/trim: 1 hour
- Cleanup and organization: 1 hour

**Total: 7-8 hours of active cutting**

### Weight Accountability Check

Let's make sure we didn't lose anything:

| Category | Weight | % of Carcass |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Retail cuts (shoulder, loin, legs, ribs) | 220 lbs | 34.6% |
| Sausage trim | 84 lbs | 13.2% |
| Stew meat/scraps | 25 lbs | 3.9% |
| Bones | 97 lbs | 15.3% |
| Fat | 39 lbs | 6.1% |
| Waste (connective tissue, unusable bits, processing loss) | 171 lbs | 26.9% |
| **TOTAL** | **636 lbs** | **100%** |

That matches our starting carcass weight (736 lbs dressed minus 100 lbs of external materials = 636 lbs). Good.

**Note on yield percentages:** These match the General Butcher Guide standards for Canine processing (35% retail, 13% trim, 15% bones, 6% fat). The remaining weight includes stew meat and waste.

**Note on blood:** The 64 lbs of blood was already drained during field dressing and is not included in the 736 lbs dressed weight that arrives at the shop.

**Note on the 220 lbs retail cuts:** This comes from the prime portions of each primal - the best roasts and steaks. The remaining usable meat from each primal (tougher sections, odd-shaped pieces, connective tissue-heavy areas) goes into the trim and stew meat categories.

# Chapter 4: Byproducts - Sausage, Stock, and Tallow
## Making Money from Scraps

You've got your retail cuts packaged and ready. Now it's time to turn the leftovers into profit.

### Part 1: Wolf Sausage

You've got **84 pounds of trim** sitting in buckets. It's not pretty—shoulder scraps, shank meat, neck pieces, belly odds and ends—but it's perfectly good meat.

The problem: wolf meat is LEAN. Too lean for good sausage. And it's GAMEY—that metallic, carnivore flavor needs masking with extra fat.

**The ratio:** 60% wolf, 40% pork fat (by weight)

This is richer than standard sausage (70/30), but necessary for wolf. The extra fat mellows out the metallic taste and improves texture.

**The math:**
- 84 lbs wolf trim (60% of final mixture)
- 56 lbs pork fat (40% of final mixture)
- Total: 140 lbs of sausage mixture

**Cost of pork fat:** 2 silver per pound (you're buying in bulk from a pig butcher)
- 56 lbs × 2 sp = **11.2 gold** for fat

#### Making the Sausage

**Step 1: Grind the meat**

You'll need a meat grinder (manual or powered—doesn't matter). Run the wolf trim through TWICE:
- First pass: coarse grind
- Second pass: medium grind

Mix in the pork fat during the second pass so it distributes evenly.

**Step 2: Season it**

Wolf meat is GAMEY. You need strong flavors to mask that metallic, wild taste.

**Mira's Wolf Sausage Spice Blend** (per 100 lbs of meat):
- Sage: 4 oz (6 sp)
- Juniper berries: 3 oz (5 sp)
- Black pepper: 2 oz (5 cp)
- Garlic (dried/powdered): 4 oz (8 cp)
- Salt: 3 lbs (3 cp)
- Fennel seed: 2 oz (4 sp)

**Total spice cost:** 1 gold, 6 silver, 6 copper (for 100 lbs)

For 140 lbs of sausage, scale up: **2.3 gold in spices** (2 gp, 3 sp, 2 cp)

Mix the spices thoroughly into the ground meat. Let it rest for 30 minutes so the flavors marry.

**Step 3: Stuff the casings**

You'll need **natural hog casings** (purchased from a pig butcher or specialty supplier). For 140 lbs of sausage, you need about 80 feet of casing.

**Casings cost:** 2.3 gold

Use a sausage stuffer (or a funnel and a lot of patience). Stuff the casings firm but not tight—leave a little give or they'll burst when cooked.

Twist the sausages every 6 inches to make links (or leave them as long coils if you prefer).

**Step 4: Hang and dry**

Hang the sausages in a cool, dry place for 24 hours. This firms them up and lets the flavors develop.

#### Sausage Yield and Pricing

**Yield:** 138 lbs of finished sausage (you lose ~2 lbs to moisture and trimming)

**Pricing:**
- **Fresh sausage:** 6 silver per pound
- **Smoked sausage:** 8 silver per pound (if you have a smokehouse)

Most customers want fresh, so we'll assume **6 sp/lb**.

**Gross revenue:** 138 lbs × 6 sp = **82.8 gold**

**Costs:**
- Pork fat: 11.2 gp
- Spices: 2.3 gp
- Casings: 2.3 gp
- Labor (2 people, 4 hours each): 4 gp

**Total cost:** 19.8 gold

**Net profit from sausage:** 82.8 - 19.8 = **63 gold**

Not bad for meat that was headed for the scrap bin.

### Part 2: Bone Stock

You've got **97 pounds of bones** from the spine, ribs, legs, and skull. Wolf bones make GOOD stock—rich, gelatinous, full of flavor (in a gamey, wolfy way).

#### Making the Stock

**What you need:**
- 97 lbs of bones (roasted first to develop flavor)
- 18 gallons of water
- Aromatics: onions, carrots, celery, bay leaves, peppercorns
- Large stockpot(s) or cauldron
- 8-10 hours of simmering time

**Cost of aromatics:** About 5 silver (you're using cheap vegetables)

**Process:**
1. Roast the bones at high heat for 1 hour (develops flavor, renders out fat)
2. Put bones in a giant pot, cover with water
3. Add aromatics
4. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer
5. Simmer for 8-10 hours, skimming foam occasionally
6. Strain, discard bones and vegetables
7. Let stock cool, skim off fat

#### Stock Yield and Pricing

**Yield:** About 13 gallons of stock (you lose volume to evaporation)

That's **104 pints** (a pint is the standard selling unit).

**Pricing:**
- Plain stock: 3 silver per pint
- "Fortified" stock (reduced to concentrate flavor): 4 silver per pint

We'll assume **3.5 sp/pint average**.

**Gross revenue:** 104 pints × 3.5 sp = **36.4 gold**

**Costs:**
- Aromatics: 5 sp
- Firewood (10 hours of fire): 2 gp
- Labor (1 person monitoring, mostly passive): 1 gp
- Containers (jars, bottles): 2.6 gp

**Total cost:** 6.1 gold

**Net profit from stock:** 36.4 - 6.1 = **30.3 gold**

**Note on remainder bones:** Unlike owlbears (which have 100+ lbs of unusable wing bones and skull fragments), most wolf bones are suitable for stock. If you have small bone shards or fragments that aren't worth processing, you can sell them as bone meal to farmers for 2-3 gold, but it's rarely worth the effort. This guide assumes all 97 lbs of bones go into stock.

### Part 3: Rendered Tallow

You've got **39 pounds of fat** from the carcass. It's not much (wolves are LEAN), but it's enough to render into tallow.

Tallow is used for candles, soap, leather treatment, and waterproofing. It's not glamorous, but it sells.

#### Rendering Process

**What you need:**
- 39 lbs of fat (chopped into small pieces)
- Large pot
- Low heat (DON'T let it smoke)
- Cheesecloth or fine strainer
- Containers for finished tallow

**Process:**
1. Chop fat into small chunks (helps it melt faster)
2. Put fat in a pot over low heat
3. Let it melt slowly (2-3 hours)
4. Strain out the solids (cracklings)
5. Pour liquid tallow into containers
6. Let it cool and solidify

**Yield:** About 35 lbs of rendered tallow (you lose ~4 lbs to moisture and cracklings)

#### Tallow Pricing

**Market rate:** 2 silver per pound (bulk rate to soap makers and chandlers)

**Gross revenue:** 35 lbs × 2 sp = **7 gold**

**Costs:**
- Firewood: 5 sp
- Labor (1 person, 3 hours): 5 sp
- Containers: 4 sp

**Total cost:** 1.4 gold

**Net profit from tallow:** 7 - 1.4 = **5.6 gold**

### Byproducts Summary

| Product | Gross Revenue | Costs | Net Profit |
|---------|---------------|-------|------------|
| Sausage (138 lbs) | 82.8 gp | 19.8 gp | 63 gp |
| Bone Stock (104 pints) | 36.4 gp | 6.1 gp | 30.3 gp |
| Rendered Tallow (35 lbs) | 7 gp | 1.4 gp | 5.6 gp |
| **TOTAL BYPRODUCTS** | **126.2 gp** | **27.3 gp** | **98.9 gp** |

That's an extra 98.9 gold of PROFIT from stuff that would otherwise be waste. THIS is why you process the whole animal.

### Operating Costs Breakdown

#### Labor Costs

**Processing crew (3 skilled butchers):**
- Master butcher (you): 10 hours @ 2.5 gp/hour = 25 gp
- Journeyman butcher: 10 hours @ 1.5 gp/hour = 15 gp
- Apprentice/assistant: 10 hours @ 8 sp/hour = 8 gp

**Byproduct crew:**
- Sausage making (2 people, 4 hours): 4 gp
- Stock making (1 person, monitoring): 1 gp
- Tallow rendering (1 person, 3 hours): 1 gp

**Total labor (independent):** 54 gold

**Guild rates (same crew, guild pricing):**
- Master: 10 hrs × 3.5 gp/hr = 35 gp
- Journeyman: 10 hrs × 2.0 gp/hr = 20 gp
- Apprentice: 10 hrs × 0.8 gp/hr = 8 gp
- Byproduct crew: 6 gp (same)

**Total labor (guild rates):** 69 gold

#### Materials and Supplies

- **Preservation supplies** (jars, alcohol for organs, ice): 5 gp
- **Salt** (pelt, organs, sausage): 0.63 gp
  - Pelt preservation: 85 lbs × 10% = 8.5 lbs × 3 cp/lb = 25.5 cp
  - Organ preservation: 7 lbs organs × 100% = 7 lbs × 4 cp/lb = 28 cp
  - Sausage seasoning: 3 lbs × 3 cp/lb = 9 cp
  - Total: 62.5 cp ≈ 0.63 gp
- **Pork fat** (for sausage, 56 lbs): 11.2 gp
- **Spices** (sausage blend): 2.3 gp
- **Casings** (sausage): 2.3 gp
- **Aromatics** (stock): 5 sp
- **Firewood** (sausage, stock, tallow): 4.3 gp
- **Containers** (stock jars, tallow containers): 5.6 gp
- **Miscellaneous** (twine, wrapping, cleaning supplies): 3 gp

**Total materials:** 34.83 gold

#### Overhead

- **Facility use** (shop space, cold storage): 8 gp
- **Tool maintenance and sharpening**: 2 gp
- **Waste disposal** (blood, organs, scraps): 3 gp

**Total overhead:** 13 gold

### Total Operating Costs

| Category | Independent | Guild |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Labor | 54 gp | 69 gp |
| Materials | 34.83 gp | 34.83 gp |
| Overhead | 13 gp | 13 gp |
| Guild Commission (5% of gross) | — | 40.74 gp |
| **TOTAL COSTS** | **101.83 gp** | **157.57 gp** |

### Net Profit Calculation

**Independent butcher:**
- Gross revenue: 814.7 gp
- Operating costs: 101.83 gp
- **Net profit: 712.87 gold**

**Guild butcher:**
- Gross revenue: 814.7 gp
- Operating costs: 157.57 gp (includes 40.74 gp guild commission)
- **Net profit: 657.13 gold**

### Profit Margins

**Independent:** 712.87 ÷ 814.7 = **87.5% profit margin**
**Guild:** 657.13 ÷ 814.7 = **80.7% profit margin**

Those are EXCELLENT margins. The reason? Most of your revenue comes from high-value, low-cost items:
- The pelt costs almost nothing to harvest
- The organs cost 5 gp in supplies but sell for 225 gp
- The meat requires processing, but you're using the WHOLE animal

### Time Investment

**Total active work:**
- Organ harvest: 30 minutes
- Pelt removal: 1 hour
- Butchering: 7 hours
- Sausage making: 4 hours
- Stock making: 1 hour (active) + 8 hours (passive simmering)
- Tallow rendering: 3 hours
- Cleanup: 1 hour

**Active time: 17.5 hours**
**Passive time: 8 hours (stock simmering)**

**Hourly rate (independent):** 696.4 gp ÷ 17.5 hours = **39.8 gold per hour**
**Hourly rate (guild):** 676.2 gp ÷ 17.5 hours = **38.6 gold per hour**

That's INSANE money for a butcher. A skilled craftsman makes 2-3 gold per DAY. You're making nearly 40 gold per HOUR.

### What You're Really Selling

Let's look at where the money comes from:

| Category | Revenue | % of Total |
|----------|---------|------------|
| External materials | 455 gp | 56.6% |
| Retail cuts | 233.5 gp | 29.0% |
| Byproducts | 115.4 gp | 14.4% |
| **TOTAL** | **804.4 gp** | **100%** |

**The takeaway:** More than HALF your revenue comes from things that aren't the meat. The pelt, organs, and trophies are worth 455 gold. The meat? 233 gold. The scraps? 115 gold.

THIS is why you harvest the organs first. THIS is why you don't damage the pelt.

### Pricing Flexibility

You have some wiggle room depending on market conditions:

**Conservative pricing** (low-end estimates):
- Gross revenue: ~730 gp
- Net profit: ~620 gp

**Aggressive pricing** (high-end, winter markets, desperate alchemists):
- Gross revenue: ~880 gp
- Net profit: ~770 gp

**Realistic middle ground:**
- Gross revenue: 804 gp
- Net profit: 696 gp

# Chapter 6: Critical Warnings
## How to NOT Lose 200 Gold in Ten Seconds

I said this at the beginning, but I'm saying it again because people DON'T LISTEN.

The Blink Wolf has TWO organs that can RUIN your entire day if you screw them up:
1. **The Blink Node** - Teleports your meat into the rafters
2. **The Frost Sac** - Freezes your meat solid

Let me be VERY clear about what happens if you mess this up.

### The Blink Node Disaster

**What it looks like when you puncture it:**

You're cutting through the ribcage, knife slips, you hear a high-pitched *hummmmm*—

And then EVERYTHING within 2 feet just... scatters.

The shoulder you just carefully separated? It's now embedded in the ceiling.  
The loin section you were about to process? Outside in the street.  
Your favorite boning knife? Inside a barrel of salt.  
The Blink Node itself? Gone. Teleported somewhere. You'll never find it.

**What you just lost:**
- 30-50 lbs of premium meat: 25-40 gp
- The Blink Node: 100 gp
- Your dignity: priceless

**How to avoid it:**
- Approach from the SIDE, not through the sternum
- Feel for the crystalline mass BEFORE you cut
- Use slow, controlled cuts
- The moment you feel something hard and cold, STOP
- Extract it with your fingers, not your knife
- Have the alcohol jar ready BEFORE you start

### The Frost Sac Catastrophe

**What it looks like when you puncture it:**

You're gutting the throat, knife goes a little deep, you feel something pop—

And then icy-blue fluid sprays out like a broken water pipe, except instead of water, it's LIQUID COLD.

The fluid hits the shoulder. The shoulder flash-freezes solid in 10 seconds. When you try to thaw it later, the meat is crystallized mush. Completely unsellable.

You try to grab the sac to stop the leak. Your gloves freeze to your hands. You have frostbite.

**What you just lost:**
- 30-40 lbs of shoulder meat: 18-24 gp
- The Frost Sac: 125 gp
- Possibly your fingers: see a healer

**How to avoid it:**
- Wear THICK gloves
- Approach from the top of the esophagus, not the bottom
- Cut the connective tissue FIRST (at the top), THEN lift
- Support the sac from below so the weight doesn't tear it
- Never jar it in glass—use padded, insulated containers
- If you see your breath near the throat, you're close—go SLOW

### Combined Disaster Scenario

I've seen this happen ONCE. I pray to the gods I never see it again.

An apprentice punctured the Blink Node AND the Frost Sac in the same carcass. The Blink Node scattered 40 lbs of meat across the shop. The Frost Sac froze another 35 lbs solid.

**What was lost:**
- 75 lbs of premium meat: ~60 gp
- Both organs: 225 gp
- The apprentice's confidence: shattered
- My patience: obliterated

**Total loss: 285 gold** from a carcass that should have been worth 820 gold.

### Signs You're About to Make a Mistake

**Blink Node warnings:**
- You hear humming
- The organ feels warm to the touch
- You see faint silver light emanating from the ribcage
- Your knife starts vibrating

**Frost Sac warnings:**
- You see your breath near the throat
- The tissue around the sac is ice-cold
- You feel numbness in your fingers even through gloves
- The sac is visibly darker blue than surrounding tissue

If you see ANY of these signs, STOP. Slow down. Re-assess. Proceed with extreme caution.

### Emergency Protocols

**If you puncture the Blink Node:**
1. Drop your knife
2. Back away from the carcass (2-foot radius)
3. Wait 30 seconds for the teleportation burst to finish
4. Survey the damage
5. Find your scattered meat (check rafters, outside, barrels, corners)
6. Salvage what you can
7. Write off the rest

**If you puncture the Frost Sac:**
1. DO NOT touch the fluid with bare hands
2. Move the carcass away from the leak (if possible)
3. Let the fluid drain onto the floor (NOT onto meat)
4. Assess frozen meat—if it's solid, it's probably ruined
5. Treat any frostbite immediately (warm water, NOT hot)
6. Clean up the fluid with thick gloves and absorbent material

### Prevention is Worth 225 Gold

Here's the thing: if you're CAREFUL, you'll never puncture these organs. They're not hard to extract—they're just unforgiving if you rush.

**Best practices:**
- Harvest organs FIRST, before you're tired
- Work with bright light (shadows hide details)
- Use sharp knives (dull blades slip)
- Take your time (an extra 10 minutes beats losing 225 gp)
- If you're unsure, ask someone with experience
- NEVER let an apprentice harvest these organs alone

### Final Warning

I'm not trying to scare you. I'm trying to PREPARE you.

Blink Wolves are profitable. Very profitable. But that profit assumes you don't screw up the two most valuable organs.

Treat the Blink Node like a bomb. Treat the Frost Sac like a vial of acid. Because functionally, that's what they are.

# Chapter 7: The Alpha Blink Wolf
## When Everything Gets Six Times Bigger (And More Dangerous)

So you think you've mastered the normal Blink Wolf? Congratulations. Now multiply everything by 6.5 and add several new ways to maim yourself.

An **Alpha Blink Wolf** is not just a "big" Blink Wolf. It's a 5,200-pound apex predator with organs the size of watermelons and enough meat to feed a small army.

If you get the chance to process one, DO IT. You'll make enough money to retire. Just... don't screw it up.

### The Alpha at a Glance

**Live weight:** 5,200 lbs
**Blood loss:** 416 lbs (8% of live weight, drained during field dressing)
**Dressed weight:** 4,784 lbs (after field dressing)
**Usable carcass:** 4,134 lbs (after external materials)

**Gross revenue:** 5,572 gp (net after 100 gp preservation costs)
**Operating costs:** 603.9 gp (independent) / 1,001.1 gp (guild, includes 283.6 gp commission on 5,672 gp gross)
**Net profit:** 4,968.1 gp (independent) / 4,570.9 gp (guild)

**Processing time:** 32 hours (4 days with a crew of 6-8)

### Scaling Factor

Everything on an Alpha is roughly **6.5 times bigger** than a normal Blink Wolf:

| Component | Normal | Alpha | Multiplier |
|-----------|--------|-------|------------|
| Live weight | 800 lbs | 5,200 lbs | 6.5× |
| Pelt weight | 85 lbs | 553 lbs | 6.5× |
| Blink Node weight | 3 lbs | 19.5 lbs | 6.5× |
| Frost Sac weight | 4 lbs | 26 lbs | 6.5× |
| Retail cuts | 220 lbs | 1,430 lbs | 6.5× |
| Processing time | 10 hours | 32 hours | 3.2× |

The processing time doesn't scale linearly because you need a bigger crew and better equipment, which speeds things up.

### External Materials (Alpha)

#### The Pelt (553 lbs)

This is not a pelt. This is a RUG THE SIZE OF A SMALL HOUSE.

**Dimensions:** Roughly 12 feet wide by 18 feet long when fully stretched.

**What it's worth:** 1,500 gold base price. Up to 2,000 gold in winter or to the right buyer.

**Why it's so valuable:**
- Rarity: Alphas are RARE. Most furriers will never see one.
- Size: You could use this as an actual carpet in a noble's hall
- Quality: Alpha pelts are THICK—3-4 inches of dense winter fur
- Prestige: Owning an Alpha Blink Wolf pelt is a status symbol

**How to remove it:** You'll need 3-4 people and about 3 hours. The pelt alone weighs as much as a full-grown human. Use sharp knives, work carefully, and for the love of the gods, DON'T PUNCTURE IT.

#### The Blink Node (19.5 lbs)

This thing is the size of a LARGE MELON. It's not a delicate little crystal anymore—it's a massive, pulsing, magical organ that could teleport half your shop if you drop it.

**What it's worth:** 800 gold fresh (within 30 minutes). 400 gold if you're slow.

**CRITICAL WARNING:**
If you rupture an Alpha Blink Node, the teleportation radius is **10 FEET**, and the scatter range is **500 FEET**.

I'm not exaggerating. You could lose 100-200 pounds of meat, your entire crew's tools, and possibly a PERSON if someone's standing too close.

**How to extract it:**
- You need TWO people
- Cut through the ribcage from BOTH sides simultaneously
- One person reaches in, locates the node
- The other person supports it from below
- Lift together, smooth and steady
- Have a 5-gallon jar of pure alcohol ready
- Lower it in GENTLY—don't drop it

**Preservation:** You'll need a specialized container. A 5-gallon glass jar filled with alchemist-grade alcohol. This will cost you about 20 gold, but it's worth it to preserve an 800 gp organ.

#### The Frost Sac (26 lbs)

This is a fist-sized sac on a normal wolf. On an Alpha, it's the size of a small BACKPACK, and it's full of freezing liquid.

**What it's worth:** 800 gold fresh. 400 gold if you take your time.

**CRITICAL WARNING:**
If you puncture an Alpha Frost Sac, the freeze radius is **5 FEET**, and you could lose 150-250 pounds of meat (500-700 gp worth).

Also, the fluid will give you INSTANT frostbite. We're talking "lose a finger" levels of cold.

**How to extract it:**
- Wear insulated gloves AND insulated tools
- Approach from the top of the throat
- Cut the connective tissue with EXTREME care
- You'll need two people to lift it—it weighs 26 pounds
- Place it in a heavily padded, insulated container
- Do NOT jar it—the fluid will crack any glass container

**Preservation:** Use a wooden crate lined with wool, packed with straw or sawdust for insulation. Store in the coldest part of your facility.

#### Trophy Parts (Scaled Up)

| Component | Weight | Value |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Fangs (4) | 13 lbs | 100 gp |
| Claws (16) | 19.5 lbs | 50 gp |
| Eyes (2) | ~0 lbs | 15 gp |
| Tail | 19.5 lbs | 35 gp |
| **TOTAL TROPHIES** | **52 lbs** | **200 gp** |

The fangs on an Alpha are 8-10 inches long. They're not "trophies" anymore—they're WEAPONS. Blacksmiths will buy them to forge into dagger blades or short swords.

### External Materials Summary (Alpha)

| Component | Weight | Value |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Pelt | 553 lbs | 1,500 gp |
| Blink Node | 19.5 lbs | 800 gp |
| Frost Sac | 26 lbs | 800 gp |
| Fangs | 13 lbs | 100 gp |
| Claws | 19.5 lbs | 50 gp |
| Eyes | ~0 lbs | 15 gp |
| Tail | 19.5 lbs | 35 gp |
| **TOTAL EXTERNAL** | **650 lbs** | **3,300 gp** |

*(Note: This is GROSS value. Subtract 100 gp for preservation supplies - specialized containers for watermelon-sized organs (50 gp) and massive amounts of ice (50 gp). Net is around 3,200 gp.)*

That's 3,300 gold from materials that aren't even the meat. More than HALF the total value of the Alpha comes from these external components.

### Retail Cuts (Alpha)

The meat scaling is straightforward: multiply everything by 6.5.

**Total Usable Meat from Primals** (scaled from 320 lbs × 6.5 = 2,080 lbs):

| Primal Section | Total Usable Weight | Retail Cuts | Trim/Stew | Avg Price | Retail Value |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Shoulder (both) | 715 lbs | 455 lbs | 260 lbs | ~8 sp/lb | 403 gp |
| Loin/Saddle | 553 lbs | 553 lbs | 0 lbs | ~1 gp/lb | 562 gp |
| Hindquarters (both) | 650 lbs | 422 lbs | 228 lbs | ~7.5 sp/lb | 474 gp |
| Ribs/Belly | 163 lbs | 0 lbs | 163 lbs | ~5 sp/lb | 78 gp |
| **TOTALS** | **2,081 lbs usable** | **1,430 lbs retail** | **651 lbs trim/stew** | **~7.4 sp avg** | **1,517 gp** |

**Note on retail vs. usable meat:**
- Normal Blink Wolf: 320 lbs usable → 220 lbs retail cuts + 100 lbs trim
- Alpha Blink Wolf: 2,081 lbs usable → 1,430 lbs retail cuts + 651 lbs trim
- Scaling factor: 6.5× (consistent)

The 1,430 lbs of retail cuts are the premium steaks and roasts sold to customers. The remaining 651 lbs gets processed into sausage (618 lbs trim) and stew meat (33 lbs scraps).

### Byproducts (Alpha)

#### Sausage

**Trim weight:** 618 lbs (60% of mixture for gamey wolf meat)
**Add pork fat (40% for gamey meat ratio):** 412 lbs
**Total sausage mixture:** 1,030 lbs
**Processing loss (2%):** 21 lbs
**Final yield:** 1,009 lbs

**Costs:**
- Pork fat: 82.4 gp (412 lbs × 2 sp/lb)
- Spices: 16.9 gp (scaled for 1,030 lb mixture)
- Casings: 22.1 gp (scaled for 1,009 lbs finished)
- Labor: 60 gp

**Gross revenue:** 1,009 lbs × 6 sp = 605.4 gp

**Total costs:** 181.4 gp

**Net profit:** 605.4 - 181.4 = **424 gp**

#### Bone Stock

**Bone weight:** 630.5 lbs (6.5× scaling from 97 lbs)
**Stock yield:** 780 pints

**Why the 15% bonus? (Expected 676 pints, actual 780 pints)**

Larger bones have proportionally higher marrow content and gelatin yield. A normal wolf femur might be 2 inches diameter; an Alpha femur is 5+ inches diameter. The marrow cavity scales with the square of the radius, giving disproportionately more gelatin per pound.

Additionally, larger stock pots have better heat retention and less surface evaporation per gallon, improving yield efficiency.

**Net result:** Alpha bones yield **1.24 pints per pound** vs. normal wolf's 1.07 pints per pound (16% improvement).

**Gross revenue:** 780 pints × 3.5 sp = 273 gp

**Net costs:** 40 gp (aromatics, firewood, labor, containers)

**Net profit:** 273 - 40 = **233 gp**

#### Rendered Tallow

**Fat weight:** 254 lbs (39 lbs × 6.5 scaling factor)
**Rendering loss (10%):** 25 lbs
**Rendered yield:** 229 lbs

**Gross revenue:** 229 lbs × 2 sp = 45.8 gp

**Net costs:** 8.7 gp (scaled proportionally)

**Net profit:** 45.8 - 8.7 = **37.1 gp**

### Byproducts Summary (Alpha)

| Product | Gross Revenue | Net Profit |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Sausage (1,009 lbs) | 605.4 gp | 424 gp |
| Bone Stock (780 pints) | 273 gp | 233 gp |
| Rendered Tallow (229 lbs) | 45.8 gp | 37.1 gp |
| **TOTAL BYPRODUCTS** | **924.2 gp** | **694.1 gp** |

## Alpha Operating Costs

### Labor

**Primary butchering crew (6 people, 32 hours each):**
- 1 Master butcher: 32 hrs @ 2.5 gp/hr = 80 gp
- 2 Journeymen: 2 × 32 hrs @ 1.5 gp/hr = 96 gp
- 3 Apprentices: 3 × 32 hrs @ 8 sp/hr = 76.8 gp

**Byproduct crew:**
- Sausage (3 people, 20 hours): 60 gp
- Stock (2 people, monitoring): 8 gp
- Tallow (1 person, 4 hours): 4 gp

**Organ harvest (critical task, 4 people, 5 hours):**
- 1 Master: 12.5 gp (5 hrs @ 2.5 gp/hr)
- 3 skilled assistants: 15 gp

**Total labor (independent):** 352.3 gold

**Guild rates (same crew, guild pricing):**
- Primary crew: 1 Master (32 hrs × 3.5 gp/hr) + 2 Journeymen (64 hrs × 2.0 gp/hr) + 3 Apprentices (96 hrs × 0.8 gp/hr) = 112 + 128 + 76.8 = 316.8 gp
- Byproduct crew: 72 gp (same tasks, same rates)
- Organ harvest: 27.5 gp (same)

**Total labor (guild rates):** 416.3 gold

### Materials and Supplies

- Salt (preservation): 3.5 gp
  - Organ preservation: 45 lbs organs × 100% packing = 45 lbs salt × 4 cp/lb = 1.8 gp
  - Pelt curing: 550 lbs pelt × 10% = 55 lbs salt × 3 cp/lb = 1.65 gp
  - Total: 100 lbs salt at 3.45 gp (rounded to 3.5 gp)
- Pork fat (sausage): 82.4 gp (412 lbs × 2 sp/lb for 60/40 gamey meat ratio)
- Spices (sausage): 16.9 gp (scaled for 1,030 lb mixture)
- Casings (sausage): 22.1 gp (scaled for 1,009 lbs finished)
- Aromatics (stock): 3 gp
- Specialized containers for organs: 80 gp (watermelon-sized organs require custom-built reinforced containers)
- Ice (multi-day preservation): 81.5 gp (massive amounts needed to keep organs fresh for 3-4 days until sold)
- Firewood (multiple days): 30 gp
- Misc supplies: 20 gp

**Total materials:** 339.4 gold

### Facility and Equipment

- Facility use (you'll need a WAREHOUSE): 25 gp
- Tool maintenance: 10 gp
- Waste disposal (massive amounts): 15 gp
- Equipment rental (hoists, large tables, specialized tools): 20 gp

**Total overhead:** 70 gold

## Alpha Total Operating Costs

| Category | Independent | Guild |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Labor | 352.3 gp | 416.3 gp |
| Materials | 339.4 gp | 339.4 gp |
| Overhead | 70 gp | 70 gp |
| Guild Commission (5% of 5,741.2 gp gross) | — | 287.1 gp |
| **TOTAL COSTS** | **761.7 gp** | **1,112.8 gp** |

## Alpha Net Profit

**Independent butcher:**
- Gross revenue: 5,641.2 gp (net after preservation)
- Operating costs: 761.7 gp
- **Net profit: 4,879.5 gold**

**Guild butcher:**
- Gross revenue: 5,641.2 gp (net after preservation)
- Operating costs: 1,112.8 gp (includes 287.1 gp commission on 5,741.2 gp gross)
- **Net profit: 4,528.4 gold**

## Alpha Time Investment

- Field harvest (organs, pelt): 5 hours (with crew)
- Butchering: 16 hours
- Sausage making: 5 hours
- Stock making: 4 hours active work
- Cleanup: 2 hours

**Total active work:** 32 hours (4 days with breaks)

**Hourly rate (independent):** 4,879.5 gold ÷ 32 hours = **152.5 gold per hour**
**Hourly rate (guild):** 4,528.4 gold ÷ 32 hours = **141.5 gold per hour**

That's INSANE money for a butcher. This is "retire early" money. This is "buy a shop" money.

## Alpha Special Considerations

### Workspace Requirements

You CANNOT process an Alpha Blink Wolf in a normal butcher shop. You need:
- Minimum 30×40 foot clear space
- 12-foot ceiling clearance
- Heavy-duty hoists and pulleys (carcass weighs 4,800+ lbs)
- Industrial cold storage
- Drainage for MASSIVE amounts of blood and fluids

Most butchers rent warehouse space or use specialized facilities for Alpha processing.

### Crew Requirements

You can't do this solo or with 2 people. You need 6-8 skilled workers:
- 1 Master (organs and critical cuts)
- 2-3 Journeymen (primary butchering)
- 3-4 Apprentices (hauling, cleaning, stock work)

### Organ Extraction

The Alpha organs are HUGE and much more dangerous:

**Blink Node (19.5 lbs):**
- Chaos radius if ruptured: 10 feet
- Potential meat loss: 100-200 lbs (400-800 gp)
- Requires TWO people to extract safely
- Needs a specialized container (5-gallon jar of pure alcohol)

**Frost Sac (26 lbs):**
- Freeze radius if punctured: 5 feet
- Potential meat loss: 150-250 lbs (500-700 gp)
- Requires insulated gloves AND tools
- Must be moved with extreme care (it weighs 26 pounds and is full of freezing liquid)

### Market Considerations

An Alpha Blink Wolf hitting the market is a MAJOR event. There's only so much wolf meat the local market can absorb.

**Strategy options:**

1. **Spread sales over weeks:** Prevents market saturation, maintains prices
2. **Export to other cities:** Ship preserved cuts to distant markets
3. **Take bulk orders:** Pre-sell to taverns, inns, noble houses
4. **Premium marketing:** "Alpha Blink Wolf - Once in a Lifetime Meat"

### What Adventurers Should Charge

If a party brings you an Alpha Blink Wolf:

**Field dressed, organs intact:** 1,200-1,500 gold  
**Fully processed in field:** 1,500-2,000 gold  
**Just the carcass:** 800-1,000 gold

These numbers are HIGH because:
- Alphas are incredibly rare
- Incredibly dangerous to hunt
- Bring enormous value

Most parties that can kill an Alpha know what they've got. Expect to negotiate hard.

Fair price range: **1,200-1,500 gold** for a well-preserved carcass.

## Alpha Economics Summary

**Best case scenario (independent butcher):**
- Gross revenue: 5,641.2 gp (net after preservation)
- Operating costs: 761.7 gp
- Net profit: 4,879.5 gp
- Time: 32 hours
- Hourly rate: 152.5 gp/hour

**Realistic scenario (guild member, winter pelt bonus):**
- Gross revenue: 6,141.2 gp (pelt sells for 2,000 gp in winter, net after preservation)
- Operating costs: 1,137.8 gp (includes 312.1 gp commission on 6,241.2 gp gross)
- Net profit: 5,003.4 gp

**Worst case scenario (independent, one organ ruined):**
- Gross revenue: 4,841.2 gp (lost 800 gp on Blink Node rupture, net after preservation)
- Operating costs: 761.7 gp
- Net profit: 4,079.5 gp
- Still huge, but painful

**The bottom line:** An Alpha Blink Wolf is a career-defining job. You'll make enough money to set yourself up for years. Just don't screw up the organs.

# Final Thoughts

Blink Wolves aren't for beginners. They're magical, dangerous, and unforgiving if you make mistakes. But if you know what you're doing, they're PROFITABLE.

The normal Blink Wolf (800 lbs) is a solid day's work for 700+ gold profit. The Alpha (5,200 lbs) is a once-in-a-career event worth 5,000+ gold.

**Keys to success:**

1. **Harvest organs IMMEDIATELY** - you have 30-60 minutes
2. **Don't puncture the Frost Sac** - it'll freeze your meat
3. **Don't crack the Blink Node** - it'll teleport your meat
4. **Take care with the pelt** - it's worth more than all the meat
5. **Price the meat realistically** - it's not premium dining, don't pretend it is
6. **Move fast** - wolf meat spoils like any other meat

**Final advice:**

If you've never processed a Blink Wolf before, work with someone who has. The organs are tricky, the meat is tough, and the margin for error is thin.

If you HAVE done this before, you know the value. Charge accordingly, work carefully, and make your profit.

May your blades stay sharp, your organs stay intact, and your profits stay high.
