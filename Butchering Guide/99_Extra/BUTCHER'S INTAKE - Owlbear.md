# 🥩 BUTCHER'S INTAKE FORM - OWLBEAR
**"So... you brought me an Owlbear. Let's talk about what you want done with it."**

---

## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE FOR DM

**Use this when players bring an Owlbear carcass to a butcher.**
The butcher will ask these questions to determine what the players want.

---

## 🎭 ROLEPLAYING THE BUTCHER

*"Alright, you've got a 1,420-pound owlbear carcass here. That damn feathered bear. I can process this for you, but I need to know what you want. I can give you cash for the whole thing, or I can break it down custom for you. What'll it be?"*

---

## 💰 OPTION 1: SELL THE WHOLE CARCASS (Quick & Easy)

**Butcher's Offer:**
*"I'll buy the whole thing off you right now. Field-dressed and ready to go?"*

| Condition | Butcher Pays | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| ✅ Perfect condition (field dressed, organs preserved) | **400-500 gp** | Fair wholesale price |
| ⚠️ Poor condition (not field dressed, organs spoiled) | **200-300 gp** | Butcher has more work to do |
| ❌ Musk gland damaged | **150-200 gp** | 50-75 lbs of meat ruined |

**Players get cash immediately, butcher does all the work.**

*"Done? Great. Here's your gold. Now get out of my shop, I've got work to do."*

---

## 🔪 OPTION 2: CUSTOM PROCESSING (Players choose what they want)

*"You want me to process this custom? Alright, let me get my ledger. This'll take a couple days, and I'll charge you for labor. But you'll get exactly what you want. Let's go through the options..."*

---

### 📝 STEP 1: External Materials (The Valuable Stuff)

*"First, the easy money. I can sell these to the right buyers, or you can keep 'em if you've got a use for them."*

#### **The Hide (115 lbs) - "Feather-Leather"**
- [ ] **SELL to tanner** → **105 gp** to players (butcher takes a 5% commission)

#### **The Plumage (8 lbs) - Feathers**
- [ ] **SELL to fletchers/scribes** → **40 gp** to players
- [ ] **KEEP for yourself** → Players take the feathers (good for 600+ arrows)

#### **Trophy Parts (Beak 18 lbs + Talons 17 lbs)**
- [ ] **SELL to weaponsmiths/collectors** → **30 gp** to players
- [ ] **KEEP for yourself** → Cool trophies (beak makes a great wall mount)

**💵 External Materials Total:** Up to **200 gp** (if selling all)

### 🥩 STEP 2: The Meat - How Do You Want It Cut?

---

#### **🦅 AVIAN HALF (Chest & Wings) - 240 lbs**

*"The top half is bird meat - lean, dark, gamey. You CANNOT overcook this or it'll be like boot leather."*
