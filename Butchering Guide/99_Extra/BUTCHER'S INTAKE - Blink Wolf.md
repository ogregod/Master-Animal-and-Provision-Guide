# 🐺 BUTCHER'S INTAKE FORM - BLINK WOLF
**"A Blink Wolf? Normal or Alpha? ...Oh gods, please tell me you didn't kill an Alpha."**

---

## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE FOR DM

**Use this when players bring a Blink Wolf carcass to a butcher.**
The butcher will ask these questions to determine what the players want.

⚠️ **Important:** There are TWO versions - Normal (800 lbs) and Alpha (5,200 lbs). The Alpha is a MASSIVE undertaking.

---

## 🎭 ROLEPLAYING THE BUTCHER

### **For Normal Blink Wolf:**
*"Alright, you've got a Blink Wolf here. 736 pounds dressed. Not the tastiest meat - it's gamey, metallic, tough - but it's profitable. I can buy it outright or process it custom. What do you want?"*

### **For Alpha Blink Wolf:**
*"Wait. WAIT. Is that... is that an ALPHA Blink Wolf?! Do you have ANY idea what you've brought me? This thing is massive! I'm going to need a WAREHOUSE for this. This is at least four days of work. Are you SURE you want me to process this custom, or do you just want to sell it to me for... let's say 1,200 gold and call it a day?"*

---

## 💰 OPTION 1: SELL THE WHOLE CARCASS (Quick & Easy)

**Butcher's Offer:**

| Size | Condition | Butcher Pays | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Normal** | Perfect (field dressed, organs fresh) | **350-400 gp** | Fair wholesale |
| **Normal** | Poor (not field dressed) | **200-250 gp** | More work for butcher |
| **Alpha** | Perfect (field dressed, organs fresh) | **1,200-1,500 gp** | Career-defining purchase |
| **Alpha** | Poor condition | **800-1,000 gp** | Risky investment |
| **Alpha** | Blink Node ruptured | **400-600 gp** | Major value loss (800 gp organ ruined) |

**Players get cash immediately, butcher does all the work.**

*"Done? Excellent. Here's your gold. Now I've got work to do."*

---

## 🔪 OPTION 2: CUSTOM PROCESSING

*"Custom processing? Alright, let me warn you: wolf meat is GAMEY. It's edible, it's nutritious, but it's not delicious. You sure you want steaks instead of just selling to me? ...Okay, your funeral. Let's talk options."*

## 💬 SAMPLE DIALOGUE TREE

**Use this as a script at the table:**

---

**Players:** *"We killed a Blink Wolf and brought it to your shop."*

**Butcher:** *"A Blink Wolf? {inspects} Okay, normal sized. Not an Alpha, thank the gods. Alright, you've got two choices: I buy the whole thing for 350-400 gold, or I process it custom. Fair warning: wolf meat is GAMEY. Metallic. Tough. Not delicious. You want it anyway?"*

**Players:** *"Yes, custom processing."*

**Butcher:** *"Your funeral. Let's talk about what you want done with it. First, the valuable parts - the pelt and organs. Those are worth WAY more than the meat..."*

**→ Go through External Materials**

**Butcher:** *"Alright, the pelt and organs are sorted. Now the meat. 220 pounds of tough, gamey wolf. I can cut it into steaks and roasts, but honestly? It's better as sausage. Heavy spices, mixed with fat. Actually tastes good that way. What do you want?"*

**→ Go through Meat Options**

**Butcher:** *"Want me to make sausage from the scraps? Stock from the bones?"*

**→ Byproducts**

**Butcher:** *"Alright, let me tally this up... {calculates} Total value is X gold. Processing fee is 40 gold, plus guild commission. Come back in 2-3 days."*

---

**For Alpha (if players somehow killed one):**

**Butcher:** *"Wait... WAIT. That's... that's an ALPHA Blink Wolf. Do you have ANY IDEA what you've brought me?! This thing weighs 4,800 pounds! I need a WAREHOUSE! A full CREW! This is FOUR DAYS of work!"*

*{Takes a deep breath}*

*"Okay. OKAY. Listen. I will give you 1,200 gold RIGHT NOW for this whole carcass and you walk away. OR... or I can process it, and you'll get close to 5,000 gold worth of product, but it'll cost you 700-750 gold in processing fees and take four days minimum. What's it gonna be?"*

**→ Players choose**

*"Gods help me. Alright. Let's do this. But if something goes wrong with that Blink Node, I'm NOT paying for it. That thing is worth 800 gold and it's FRAGILE."*
