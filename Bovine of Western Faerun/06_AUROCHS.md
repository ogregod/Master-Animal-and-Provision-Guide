# AUROCHS
## Wild Cattle of Ancient Faerûn

*The ancestors of all domestic cattle still roam wilderness areas across Western Faerûn. Massive, aggressive, and incredibly dangerous - aurochs are hunted by adventurers seeking glory, meat, and trophy horns. This is not farming. This is dangerous game hunting that can kill the unprepared.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## YIELDS & PROCESSING

### **Standard Bull (2,300 lb, successfully hunted)**

```
Live Weight: 2,300 lbs (MASSIVE)
↓ (58% dressing - wild condition, heavy bone)
Dressed: 1,334 lbs
↓ (7 days aging - minimal, wild game)
Aged: 1,280 lbs
↓ (34% retail - wild game processing)
Retail Cuts: 435 lbs

Total Yield: 18.9% (lower for wild game, but HUGE volume)
```

### **Processing Time**

**Total Active Labor:** 20-25 hours (MASSIVE animal, community effort often required)

**Timeline:**
- **Field dressing:** 4-6 hours (MANDATORY - animal too large to transport whole)
  - Requires 3-5 experienced hunters/butchers working together
  - Bleed, gut, skin, quarter on-site
- Transport quarters to village (wagon required)
- Aging: 7 days (minimal - wild game, limited refrigeration)
- Primal breakdown: 4-6 hours (massive quarters, heavy lifting)
- Retail fabrication: 10-14 hours (HUGE meat volume, careful wild game processing)

**Labor Cost:** ~120-150 sp total

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Field dressing: ~50-60 sp (4-5 hunters × 4-6 hours × share of kill value)
- Butcher processing: ~70-90 sp (18 hours × 4-5 sp/hour journeyman/experienced rate)

**Note:** Aurochs processing often handled as COMMUNITY EVENT - hunters share labor, meat distributed among participants. Commercial processing rare due to massive scale.

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Economic Mathematics, Labor Cost Calculations**

**Field Dressing:** REQUIRED immediately. Animal too large to transport whole.

**Trophy Hunting:** Aurochs horns = adventurer status symbol
**Ritual Hunts:** Some cultures hunt aurochs as manhood rites
**Feast Meat:** Successful hunt = community celebration (massive meat volume)
**Adventurer's Prize:** "I killed an aurochs" = bragging rights

**Processing:** Community effort (too large for individual butcher)

**Taboo:** Wasteful hunting (kill for trophies only) considered dishonorable

---

## FIELD DRESSING & TRANSPORT

**Critical:** Aurochs MUST be field-dressed on-site (too heavy to transport whole)

**Process:**
1. Bleed immediately (within 15 minutes of death)
2. Remove organs (save heart, liver for transport)
3. Quarter carcass (4 primal sections)
4. Transport quarters to processing location (wagon required)

**Time:** 4-6 hours field processing with experienced team

**Spoilage Risk:** Summer hunts must reach cold storage within 24 hours

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Processing Techniques, Large Wild Game Field Dressing** for complete methods.

---

## PRESERVATION METHODS

**Recommended:**
- **Smoking** (primary method - 10-14 days)
- **Salting** (emergency preservation, field conditions)
- **Immediate consumption** (feast after successful hunt)
- **Selling fresh** (to butchers/markets if nearby)

**Challenge:** Massive volume = preservation logistics challenge

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods, Large Game Volume Processing** for complete methods.
