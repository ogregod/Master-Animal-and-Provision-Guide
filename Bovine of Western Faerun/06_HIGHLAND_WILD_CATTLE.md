# HIGHLAND WILD CATTLE
## Feral Descendants of Abandoned Stock

*Centuries ago, cattle escaped farms during raids, plagues, and abandonments. Their descendants roam highland wilderness areas today - fully wild, aggressive, and physically distinct from their domestic ancestors. Smaller than aurochs but more dangerous than scrub cattle, they occupy the middle ground between.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

---

## CULTURAL NOTES

**Frontier Hunting:** Common wild game target (more accessible than aurochs)
**Mixed Reputation:** Some see them as "feral pests," others as noble wild game
**Conservation Debate:** Some regions protect herds, others encourage culling
**Adventurer Starter:** "My first big game hunt" - stepping stone to aurochs

**Processing:** Standard butcher can handle (unlike aurochs community effort)

**Local Names:** "Highland Wild," "Ghost Cattle," "Hill Runners" (regional variations)

---

## HUNTING CONSIDERATIONS

**Easier Than Aurochs:**
- Smaller size (less dangerous)
- More predictable behavior
- Can be solo'd by experienced hunter
- Transportable without field dressing

**Harder Than Scrub:**
- More aggressive (will fight rather than flee)
- Better herd defense
- Faster, more athletic
- Warier of humans

**Recommended Approach:** Treat as dangerous game, not livestock. Respect the horns.

---

## FIELD PROCESSING OPTIONS

**Option 1 - Transport Whole:**
- Kill within 5 miles of butcher/camp
- Bleed and gut on-site
- Wagon transport to processing location
- Best for quality (controlled aging environment)

**Option 2 - Field Dress & Quarter:**
- Remote kills (8+ miles from processing)
- Full field dressing
- Quarter and pack out
- Higher spoilage risk

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Processing Techniques, Mid-Size Wild Game** for complete methods.

## PRESERVATION METHODS

**Recommended:**
- **Smoking** (7-10 days, standard wild game)
- **Fresh sale** (to butchers if nearby)
- **Immediate consumption** (hunting party meals)
- **Jerky** (lean cuts, travel rations)

**Advantage over Aurochs:** Manageable volume = easier preservation logistics

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods, Wild Game** for complete methods.
