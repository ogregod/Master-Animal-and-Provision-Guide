## PRESERVATION METHODS

### **Recommended: Cold Smoking (Brisket)**

**Why This Works:** Grass-fed beef's lean profile is ideal for smoking.

**Process:**
1. Salt cure 24-48 hours
2. Rinse and air-dry 8-12 hours
3. Cold smoke 48-72 hours (below body temperature)
4. Store in cool, dry location

**Salt Cure Recipe:**
- 80% rock salt (1 cp/lb)
- 15% brown sugar
- 5% Prague Powder #1 (safety)
- Ratio: 1 oz cure per 1 lb meat

**Wood Selection:**
- Oak: 2 cp/lb (economical, excellent results)
- Apple: 3 cp/lb (premium flavor, sweet smoke)
- Hickory: 4 cp/lb (strong traditional flavor)

**Best Cuts:** Brisket (exceptional), Chuck roast (very good), Round roasts (good)

**Storage Life:** 2-4 months (cool, dry); 6-8 months (vacuum sealed)

**Weight Loss:** 25-30%

**Example:**
- 20 lb brisket → 14 lbs smoked
- Fresh value: 40 sp
- Smoked value: 56 sp (at 4 sp/lb premium)
- Costs: 22 sp (salt, wood, labor)
- Net benefit: Extended storage (months vs. days)

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods, Northern Faerûn Cold Smoking**

### **Alternative: Corned Beef (Brine Curing)**

**Process:** Submerge in brine 7-14 days, refrigerated

**Brine (per gallon water):**
- 1.25 lbs rock salt
- 0.5 oz Prague Powder #1
- 0.5 lbs brown sugar
- Spices: black pepper, coriander, mustard seed, bay leaves, garlic

**Ratio:** 1 gallon brine per 5 lbs meat

**Best Cuts:** Brisket (traditional), Round (lean), Chuck (becomes very tender)

**Storage:** 4-6 months in brine (refrigerated)

## QUALITY GRADING

- **Choice Grade:** 40% of well-fed steers (moderate marbling)
- **Select Grade:** 55% of cattle (slight marbling, baseline)
- **Standard Grade:** 5% (very lean, minimal marbling)

**Grass-fed cattle naturally grade lower** than grain-fed due to less marbling, but produce healthier, more flavorful beef preferred by many customers.

**Age Impact:**
- 18-24 months: Optimal tenderness (A-B maturity)
- 24-30 months: Good quality, requires full aging
- 30+ months: Tougher, extended aging or grinding recommended
