# NEVERWINTER NORTHERN DAIRY CATTLE
## Cold-Hardy Milk Production

*Northern dairy requires hardy cattle that produce rich milk in cold climates. These cattle survive harsh winters, produce high-butterfat milk for the northern diet, and provide excellent beef when culled.*

## QUICK STATS

**Primary Purpose:** Dairy (cold climate milk production)
**Secondary Purpose:** Beef (cull cows)
**Origin:** Neverwinter region, bred for cold tolerance
**Availability:** Common in The North, rare elsewhere
**Climate Adaptation:** Cold-hardy, winter specialists
**Herd Size:** 10-50 head (smaller northern dairies)

---

## PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

**Size:** 1,100-1,400 lbs (larger for cold climate)
**Appearance:**
- Thick winter coat (sheds in summer)
- Black, red, or brindle
- Smaller ears (reduce freezing risk)
- Heavy body condition (cold insulation)

**Temperament:** Calm, cold-adapted

---

## MILK PRODUCTION

**Daily Yield:** 3-4 gallons (lower volume, higher quality)
**Milk Quality:** Very high butterfat (6-7%) - critical for northern nutrition
**Seasonal:** Strong summer production, reduced winter
**Productive Years:** 6-12 years (hardy, long-lived)

**Milk Products:**
- Rich cream and butter (high fat content)
- Dense cheese (survives winter storage)
- Winter calories essential for northern diet

## BEEF PROCESSING (Cull Cows)

### **Yields (1,200 lb cull cow - BEST dairy beef)**

```
Live Weight: 1,200 lbs
↓ (62% dressing - good body condition)
Dressed: 744 lbs
↓ (21 days aging - longer for cold climate)
Aged: 714 lbs
↓ (38.5% retail - BEST dairy yield)
Retail Cuts: 275 lbs

Total Yield: 22.9% (nearly matches beef cattle!)
```

**Why better?** Cold-adapted cattle maintain better body condition, more intramuscular fat for insulation.
