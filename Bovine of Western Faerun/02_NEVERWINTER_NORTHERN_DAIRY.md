# NEVERWINTER NORTHERN DAIRY CATTLE
## Cold-Hardy Milk Production

*Northern dairy requires hardy cattle that produce rich milk in cold climates. These cattle survive harsh winters, produce high-butterfat milk for the northern diet, and provide excellent beef when culled.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## QUICK STATS

**Primary Purpose:** Dairy (cold climate milk production)
**Secondary Purpose:** Beef (cull cows)
**Origin:** Neverwinter region, bred for cold tolerance
**Availability:** Common in The North, rare elsewhere
**Climate Adaptation:** Cold-hardy, winter specialists
**Herd Size:** 10-50 head (smaller northern dairies)

---

## PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

**Size:** 1,100-1,400 lbs (larger for cold climate)
**Appearance:**
- Thick winter coat (sheds in summer)
- Black, red, or brindle
- Smaller ears (reduce freezing risk)
- Heavy body condition (cold insulation)

**Temperament:** Calm, cold-adapted

---

## MILK PRODUCTION

**Daily Yield:** 3-4 gallons (lower volume, higher quality)
**Milk Quality:** Very high butterfat (6-7%) - critical for northern nutrition
**Seasonal:** Strong summer production, reduced winter
**Productive Years:** 6-12 years (hardy, long-lived)

**Milk Products:**
- Rich cream and butter (high fat content)
- Dense cheese (survives winter storage)
- Winter calories essential for northern diet

## DAIRY VS. BEEF ECONOMICS

### **Productive Dairy Cow (Lifetime Value):**

```
Purchase: 700-1,000 sp (premium for cold-hardy genetics)
+ Dairy revenue: 45-60 sp/year × 9 years (long-lived, hardy) = 405-540 sp
  (Lower volume but MUCH higher butterfat = premium cream/butter/cheese value)
+ Cull beef value: 550-600 sp (BEST dairy beef!)
= Total lifetime value: 1,255-1,540 sp revenue

Net return: 255-540 sp profit after feed costs (winter feeding expensive but offset by quality)
```

**Note:** Northern dairy cattle are the BEST economic investment of any dairy breed due to:
1. Longest productive life (9+ years vs 5-7 for other dairy)
2. Highest value products (6-7% butterfat commands premium pricing)
3. Best cull beef yields (22.9% - nearly matches dedicated beef cattle)

### **Straight Beef Purchase (Comparison):**

```
Purchase beef steer: 350-400 sp (similar size)
+ Processing (minimal - no daily milking labor)
= Immediate beef value: 450-500 sp retail

Net return: 100-150 sp profit (quicker turnover, less labor)
```

**Northern dairy beats straight beef by 2-3x over lifetime** - but requires 9 years and daily care.

### **When to Cull Dairy Cows:**

**Cull when:**
- Production drops below 2 gallons/day (not economical with northern winter feeding)
- Age exceeds 12 years (declining fertility)
- Health issues (critical in cold climate - cannot risk loss)
- Market conditions favor beef over dairy

**Optimal culling:** Year 10-12 of productive life, when milk production declining but cold-adapted body condition ensures EXCELLENT beef quality (superior to urban/heartlands dairy)

**Critical advantage:** Northern dairy cull beef commands highest prices of any dairy breed (22.9% yield + "northern grass-fed" premium marketing).

## BEEF PROCESSING (Cull Cows)

### **Yields (1,200 lb cull cow - BEST dairy beef)**

```
Live Weight: 1,200 lbs
↓ (62% dressing - good body condition)
Dressed: 744 lbs
↓ (21 days aging - longer for cold climate)
Aged: 714 lbs
↓ (38.5% retail - BEST dairy yield)
Retail Cuts: 275 lbs

Total Yield: 22.9% (nearly matches beef cattle!)
```

### **Processing Time**

**Total Active Labor:** 15 hours average

**Timeline:**
- Initial processing: 2-3 hours (slaughter to hung)
- Aging: 21 days (longer for optimal tenderness - cold climate cattle)
- Primal breakdown: 2-3 hours
- Retail fabrication: 8-9 hours (more time due to best dairy yields)

**Labor Cost:** ~60 sp (15 hours × 4 sp/hour journeyman rate)

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Economic Mathematics, Labor Cost Calculations**

**Why better?** Cold-adapted cattle maintain better body condition, more intramuscular fat for insulation.
