# GOLDENFIELDS DRAFT OXEN
## Agricultural Workhorses of the Western Heartlands

*For every field plowed, every wagon hauled, every harvest brought in - draft oxen make Goldenfields the breadbasket of Western Faerûn. These gentle giants work 8-12 years before retirement, then provide substantial beef yields. Tough, flavorful meat perfect for long braises and stews.*

## YIELDS & PROCESSING

### **Typical Cull Ox (1,700 lb, 10 years old)**

```
Live Weight: 1,700 lbs
↓ (58% dressing - lower due to age/work)
Dressed: 986 lbs
↓ (14 days aging - shorter for tougher meat)
Aged: 946 lbs
↓ (35% retail - more waste from worked muscles)
Retail Cuts: 331 lbs

Total Yield: 19.5% (lower than beef cattle due to age)
```

**Why lower?** Older animals, worked muscles create more connective tissue, lower fat cover.

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods** for complete techniques.
