# DAGGERFORD VALLEY DAIRY CATTLE
## Traditional Heartlands Dairy Production

*The Daggerford Valley produces milk, cheese, and butter for the Western Heartlands. These cattle are hardier than urban dairy breeds, bred for grass-based production on family farms. Good milk producers that also provide quality beef when culled.*

**Secondary Purpose:** Beef (when culled)

**Origin:** Daggerford River Valley

**Availability:** Common in Western Heartlands, available on Sword Coast

**Climate Adaptation:** Temperate, grass-based

**Typical Herd Size:** 15-80 head (family dairy farms)

**Market Position:** Traditional dairy, good beef when culled

---

## PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

**Dairy Cows:** 1,000-1,300 lbs (larger than urban dairy)
**Cull Cows for Beef:** 1,000-1,200 lbs

**Appearance:**
- Red, brown, or fawn colored (traditional)
- Gentle expression, large eyes
- Good body condition (grass-fed)
- Strong legs (pasture grazing)

**Temperament:** Very docile, family-friendly

---

## MILK PRODUCTION

**Daily Yield:** 3-5 gallons per cow (grass-based, seasonal variation)

**Lactation:** 10 months producing

**Productive Years:** 5-10 years

**Milk Quality:** Very high butterfat (5-6%), excellent for cheese

**Annual Revenue per Cow:** 150-200 gallons direct milk sales + cheese/butter production

---

## DAIRY VS. BEEF ECONOMICS

### **Productive Dairy Cow (Lifetime Value):**

```
Purchase: 550-850 sp (productive cow)
+ Milk revenue: 30-40 sp/year × 7 years (average productive life) = 210-280 sp
+ Cheese/butter value: 20-30 sp/year × 7 years = 140-210 sp
+ Cull beef value: 420-480 sp (when retired)
= Total lifetime value: 770-970 sp revenue

Net return: 100-300 sp profit after feed costs (grass-based = lower feed costs)
```

### **Straight Beef Purchase (Comparison):**

```
Purchase beef steer: 350-400 sp (similar size)
+ Processing (minimal - no daily milking labor)
= Immediate beef value: 450-500 sp retail

Net return: 100-150 sp profit (quicker turnover, less labor)
```

### **When to Cull Dairy Cows:**

**Cull when:**
- Production drops below 2.5 gallons/day (not economical for grass-based system)
- Age exceeds 10 years (declining fertility/milk quality)
- Health issues affect milk production or mobility
- Market conditions favor beef over dairy

**Optimal culling:** Year 7-10 of productive life, when milk production declining but grass-fed body condition still excellent (superior beef quality to urban dairy)

**Advantage over urban dairy:** Grass-fed cull cows yield better beef (22.5% vs 21.5%) and command premium "grass-fed dairy beef" pricing.

```

### **Processing Time**

**Timeline:**
- Initial processing: 2-3 hours (slaughter to hung)
- Aging: 14 days (moderate aging)
- Primal breakdown: 2-3 hours
- Retail fabrication: 7-8 hours (slightly more due to better yields)

**Labor Cost:** ~56 sp (14 hours × 4 sp/hour journeyman rate)

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Economic Mathematics, Labor Cost Calculations**

**Better than urban dairy due to grass-based feeding and better body condition.**
