# GORGON
## WARNING: NOT SUITABLE FOR PROCESSING

*This is NOT a cattle breed. This is NOT a processing guide. This is a warning.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PROCESS GORGONS

**Category:** Magical Monstrosity (NOT Bovine)
**Challenge Rating:** 5 (DEADLY for unprepared parties)
**Appearance:** Bull-like creature with metallic scales
**Habitat:** Remote wilderness, dungeons, magical areas
**Danger:** Petrifying breath weapon, metallic hide, extreme aggression

---

## WHY GORGONS ARE NOT CATTLE

**1. They Are Not Animals - They Are Monstrosities**
- Magical creatures, not natural bovines
- Intelligent (animal intelligence, but cunning)
- Actively malicious behavior

**2. Petrifying Breath Weapon**
- 30-foot cone of green gas
- Constitution save DC 13 or turn to STONE
- Permanent petrification (requires Greater Restoration to cure)
- Affects anyone nearby during "processing"

**3. Metallic Hide**
- Scales, not hide
- AC 19 (extremely difficult to cut)
- Standard butchering tools USELESS
- Requires adamantine weapons to penetrate

**4. No Edible Meat**
- Flesh is metallic, toxic, inedible
- Organs are magical constructs (not food)
- Blood is acidic/toxic
- NO nutritional value to humanoids

## WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TRY

I attempted to process one gorgon in my career. **ONCE.**

**The Experience:**
- Petrifying breath turned my apprentice to stone (survived, barely - costly Greater Restoration)
- Standard knives shattered on metallic hide
- "Meat" was gray, metallic, and toxic-smelling
- Absolutely inedible by any preservation method
- Total loss of time, tools, and nearly a life

**Net Result:**
- Cost: 200 gp (Greater Restoration scroll)
- Profit: 0 gp
- Lesson learned: PRICELESS

## ACTUAL VALUE OF GORGONS

**IF you kill one (adventurer work, not butchering):**

**Valuable Components (NOT food):**
- **Metallic Scales:** 50-80 lbs @ 5-10 gp/lb (armor crafting, magical components)
- **Petrification Gland:** 200-500 gp (alchemy, poison crafting)
- **Horns:** 30-60 gp (magical focus components)
- **Hooves:** 10-20 gp each (alchemical reagents)

**Total Value:** 500-1,000 gp in COMPONENTS (not meat)

**Processing:** Requires ALCHEMIST or SPECIALIZED MONSTER HARVESTER, not butcher

---

## IF YOU ENCOUNTER A GORGON

**As a Butcher:** RUN. This is not your job.

**As an Adventurer:**
- CR 5 monster (deadly for low-level parties)
- Bring Protection from Petrification if possible
- Target from range (breath weapon = melee hazard)
- Sell corpse to alchemist (don't process yourself)

**See Monster Manual (5E) for complete combat statistics.**

## WHY THIS ENTRY EXISTS

**Reason 1:** Young adventurers see "bull-like creature" and think "beef"
**Reason 2:** Overconfident butchers think "I can process anything bovine"
**Reason 3:** I made this mistake so you don't have to

**The Truth:** Not everything shaped like cattle is cattle. Some things are monsters. Gorgons are monsters.

*132 years as a butcher. Countless cattle processed. ONE gorgon attempt. One is enough.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet**

**"Know the difference between cattle and monsters. Your life depends on it."**

## SUMMARY

✗ **NOT CATTLE** - Magical monstrosity
✗ **NOT EDIBLE** - Toxic, metallic flesh
✗ **NOT SAFE** - Petrifying breath weapon
✓ **VALUABLE** - As alchemical components (specialist work)
✓ **AVOIDABLE** - Leave to adventurers and alchemists

**If someone offers you a gorgon to process: DECLINE.**
