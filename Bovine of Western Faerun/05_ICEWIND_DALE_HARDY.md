# ICEWIND DALE HARDY CATTLE
## Arctic Survivors of the Far North

*In the frozen wastes of Icewind Dale where temperatures plummet to -40°F, these cattle endure. Compact, heavily insulated, incredibly hardy - they survive conditions that would kill any other bovine. Limited production, but absolutely essential to Ten-Towns' survival.*

**Origin:** Ten-Towns, Icewind Dale
**Size:** 900-1,200 lbs (compact for heat retention)
