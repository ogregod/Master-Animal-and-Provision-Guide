# CALISHITE DESERT CATTLE
## Heat-Adapted Southern Specialists

*In scorching Calimshan where most cattle cannot survive, these hardy animals endure. Smaller, leaner, and supremely heat-tolerant, they provide limited but precious beef in a region where cattle are luxury items. Every pound is valued - waste is unthinkable.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## QUICK STATS

**Purpose:** Beef (limited production), some dairy
**Origin:** Calimshan desert regions
**Size:** 900-1,100 lbs (small for heat efficiency)
**Climate:** Extreme heat adaptation (up to 120°F)
**Market:** Very limited - Calimshan only, extreme premium pricing
**Rarity:** Beef is luxury/status item in desert south

---

## PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

**Size:** 900-1,100 lbs (compact for heat management)
**Appearance:**
- Short coat, light colors (tan, white, pale brown)
- Large ears (heat dissipation)
- Lean body (minimal fat insulation)
- Humped shoulders (fat storage, like zebu)
- Long legs (heat clearance from ground)

**Temperament:** Heat-tolerant, low water requirements

**Survival:** Can go 2-3 days without water (stored in hump fat)

## YIELDS & PROCESSING

### **Standard Processing (1,000 lb steer)**

```
Live Weight: 1,000 lbs
↓ (60% dressing - lean, less fat waste)
Dressed: 600 lbs
↓ (10 days aging - SHORTER, heat spoilage risk)
Aged: 576 lbs
↓ (36% retail - lean but efficient)
Retail Cuts: 207 lbs

Total Yield: 20.7% (lower due to lean condition)
```

### **Processing Time**

**Total Active Labor:** 11-12 hours average (FASTER than standard)

**Timeline:**
- Initial processing: 2 hours (slaughter to hung - RAPID, heat spoilage risk)
- Aging: 10 days (SHORTER - desert heat limits aging time)
- Primal breakdown: 2 hours (rapid processing)
- Retail fabrication: 5-7 hours (smaller animal, lean meat)

**Labor Cost:** ~48 sp (12 hours × 4 sp/hour journeyman rate)

**CRITICAL:** Desert processing requires speed over perfection. Morning slaughter, immediate cooling, rapid breakdown. Extended processing = spoilage losses.

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Economic Mathematics, Labor Cost Calculations**

**Heat Processing:** RAPID processing essential. Desert heat = extreme spoilage risk.
