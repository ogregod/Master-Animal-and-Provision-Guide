# WATERDEEP HARBOR DAIRY CATTLE
## Urban Milk Production for the City of Splendors

*Waterdeep's dairies produce fresh milk daily for hundreds of thousands of residents. These cattle are bred for high milk yields in urban conditions - hardy enough to handle city life, productive enough to justify expensive urban land. When dairy cows retire, they provide good beef as a secondary benefit.*

## MILK PRODUCTION (Primary Purpose)

**Daily Yield:** 4-7 gallons per cow per day (peak production)

**Lactation Cycle:** 10 months producing, 2 months dry (pregnancy)

**Productive Years:** 4-8 years (then culled for beef)

**Milk Quality:** High butterfat (4-5%), excellent for cheese and butter

**Market Value (Milk):**
- Fresh milk: 2 cp per gallon (wholesale to dairies)
- Retail milk: 5 cp per gallon (sold to consumers)
- Cream: 1 sp per quart
- Butter: 2 sp per pound (churned from cream)
- Cheese: 3-5 sp per pound (aged)

**Annual Milk Revenue per Cow:** ~180-250 gallons × 2 cp = 36-50 sp wholesale value

## BEEF PROCESSING (Cull Cows Only)

### **Processing Yields (1,000 lb cull cow)**

**Dairy cattle yield LESS beef than beef breeds due to lean body condition.**

**Breakdown:**
```
Live Weight: 1,000 lbs
↓ (60% dressing - leaner than beef cattle)
Dressed Weight: 600 lbs
↓ (14 days aging, 3% loss)
Aged Weight: 582 lbs
↓ (37% retail - lower than beef cattle)
Retail Cuts: 215 lbs

Total Yield: 21.5% live to retail (vs. 23% for beef cattle)
```

**Complete Breakdown:**
- **Retail Cuts:** 215 lbs (21.5%)
- **Bones:** 72 lbs (7.2%)
- **Fat Trim:** 25 lbs (2.5%) - very lean
- **Hide:** 70 lbs (7.0%)
- **Organs:** 25 lbs (2.5%)
- **Waste:** 593 lbs (59.3%)

**Note:** Dairy cows are much leaner than beef cattle - less marbling, less fat, lower yields.
