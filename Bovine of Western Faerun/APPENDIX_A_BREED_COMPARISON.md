## DOMESTIC CATTLE - DAIRY BREEDS

| Breed | Live Weight | Primary Use | Milk/Day | Cull Beef Yield | Live Price | Retail Value | Best Region |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|-----------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Waterdeep Harbor Dairy** | 1,000 lbs | Dairy (urban) | 4-7 gal | 215 lbs (21.5%) | 600-900 sp | 450-500 sp | Waterdeep, cities |
| **Daggerford Valley Dairy** | 1,100 lbs | Dairy (traditional) | 5-7 gal | 242 lbs (22%) | 650-950 sp | 500-550 sp | Western Heartlands |
| **Neverwinter Northern Dairy** | 1,200 lbs | Dairy (cold climate) | 3-4 gal | 275 lbs (22.9%) | 700-1,000 sp | 550-600 sp | The North |

**Key Notes:**
- Dairy cattle have LOWER beef yields than beef breeds (leaner, older when culled)
- Milk production is PRIMARY value
- Cull cow beef is SECONDARY income
- Northern dairy has best beef yields (cold-adapted fat coverage)

## DOMESTIC CATTLE - BEEF BREEDS

| Breed | Live Weight | Beef Type | Retail Yield | Live Price (sp/lb) | Total Live Price | Retail Value | Best Region |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Daggerford Common** | 1,250 lbs | Standard baseline | 288 lbs (23%) | 3.5 | 438-500 sp | 580-650 sp | Western Heartlands |
| **Trielta Hills Range** | 1,150 lbs | Economy/budget | 247 lbs (21.5%) | 2.8-3.2 | 322-368 sp | 450-500 sp | Trielta Hills, grasslands |
| **Baldur's Gate Market** | 1,300 lbs | Trade standard | 312 lbs (24%) | 4.5-5 | 585-650 sp | 700-800 sp | Baldur's Gate, trade routes |
| **Goldenfields Prime** | 1,300 lbs | Premium grain-fed | 325 lbs (25%) | 7-9 | 910-1,170 sp | 1,100-1,250 sp | Goldenfields, wealthy markets |
| **Cormyrean Noble Black** | 1,400 lbs | Luxury/royal | 355 lbs (25.4%) | 10-15 | 1,400-2,100 sp | 1,600-1,800 sp | Cormyr, noble estates |

**Key Notes:**
- Daggerford Common = baseline comparison
- Trielta Hills = budget option (leaner, grass-fed only)
- Baldur's Gate = guild-certified quality minimum
- Goldenfields = premium (grain finishing)
- Cormyrean = luxury (estate-bred, wine-fed)

## WORKING CATTLE

| Breed | Live Weight | Primary Use | Working Life | Retail Yield | Live Price (Working) | Cull Price | Retail Value |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|------------|--------------|
| **Goldenfields Draft Oxen** | 1,700 lbs | Agricultural draft | 8-12 years | 331 lbs (19.5%) | 1,200-1,800 sp | 350-500 sp | 600-650 sp |
| **Mirabar Mountain Oxen** | 1,900 lbs | Mining/heavy hauling | 10-15 years | 337 lbs (17.7%) | 1,500-2,500 sp | 300-450 sp | 550-600 sp |

**Key Notes:**
- Working cattle have MUCH LOWER yields (age, worked muscles, connective tissue)
- Primary value = LABOR (years of work), not meat
- Meat is "retirement bonus"
- Tougher beef = requires slow cooking methods
- Working price ≠ meat price (working value much higher)

## REGIONAL SPECIALIST BREEDS

| Breed | Live Weight | Climate | Retail Yield | Live Price (sp/lb) | Retail Value | Special Features |
|-------|-------------|---------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Calishite Desert Cattle** | 1,000 lbs | Extreme heat | 207 lbs (20.7%) | 12-18 (!) | 800-900 sp | Heat-adapted, status symbol, hump fat |
| **Icewind Dale Hardy** | 1,100 lbs | Extreme cold | 234 lbs (21.3%) | 6-8 | 700-750 sp | Dairy + beef, natural freezing, survival critical |
| **High Moor Scrub** | 950 lbs | Wilderness/harsh | 196 lbs (20.6%) | 3-4 | 400-450 sp | Semi-feral, hunted not ranched |

**Key Notes:**
- Extreme climate adaptation = premium pricing (scarcity)
- Calishite = most expensive per pound (desert scarcity, luxury status)
- Icewind Dale = survival critical (Ten-Towns would starve without them)
- High Moor Scrub = semi-wild (hunting/capturing required)

## WILD & FERAL BOVINES

| Type | Live Weight | Danger Level | Retail Yield | Acquisition | Retail Value | Trophy Value | Total Value |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Aurochs** | 2,300 lbs | CR 2 (DANGEROUS) | 435 lbs (18.9%) | Hunting (party) | 900-1,000 sp | 200-300 sp | 1,100-1,300 sp |
| **Highland Wild Cattle** | 1,500 lbs | CR 1 (Moderate) | 298 lbs (19.8%) | Hunting (2-4 hunters) | 550-650 sp | 100-150 sp | 650-750 sp |

**Key Notes:**
- Wild game = DANGER RISK (hunting required, can kill hunters)
- Lower yields (wild condition, field processing)
- Trophy value adds to total (horns, hide, skull)
- Aurochs = adventurer-level challenge
- Highland Wild = competent hunter challenge

## SPECIAL ENTRY

| Creature | Live Weight | Danger Level | EDIBLE? | Value (If Killed) | Processing |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------|-------------------|------------|
| **GORGON** | ~2,000 lbs | CR 5 (DEADLY) | **NO** | 500-1,000 sp | **ALCHEMIST ONLY** |

**CRITICAL WARNING:** NOT CATTLE. NOT FOOD. Magical monstrosity. See Gorgon Warning entry.
