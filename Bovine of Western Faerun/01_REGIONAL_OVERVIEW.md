## FOUNDATION INTEGRATION

This regional overview sets context for breed-specific profiles. Each breed description includes:
- Which regions it's found in
- Local cultural preferences for that breed
- Regional pricing variations
- Climate-specific processing considerations

**See Master Butcher's Guide:**
- **§ Preservation Methods** for complete preservation techniques referenced in regional traditions
- **§ Economic Mathematics** for pricing formulas adapted to regional markets
- **§ Processing Techniques** for universal methods adapted to regional conditions
