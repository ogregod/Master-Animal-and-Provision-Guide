# APPENDIX C: SEASONAL PROCESSING CALENDAR
## When Cattle Are Processed & Why

*Seasons drive the cattle industry. Understanding seasonal patterns helps you role-play realistic markets, explain price fluctuations, and time your party's provisioning decisions.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## ANNUAL CYCLE OVERVIEW

**Spring:** Calving, growth, grass recovery
**Summer:** Grazing, growth, peak milk production
**Fall:** PEAK PROCESSING SEASON (harvest time culling)
**Winter:** Minimal processing, preserved meat sales, survival mode

---

## SPRING (Ches, Tarsakh, Mirtul)
### March - May

**Cattle Activity:**
- Calving season (new calves born)
- Grass recovery from winter
- Dairy production increasing
- Young cattle growing on spring grass

**Processing Activity:**
- **MINIMAL** - Avoid processing breeding stock
- Emergency culls only (sick/injured animals)
- Focus on dairy production (not beef)

**Market Availability:**
- **Fresh Beef:** Limited supply, premium pricing (+10-15%)
- **Preserved Meats:** Still available from fall processing
- **Dairy:** Increasing (milk, cheese, butter production rising)

**Pricing:**
- Fresh beef: Baseline to +10%
- Preserved beef: Baseline (stockpiles from fall)
- Live cattle: Premium (breeding value highest in spring)

**Player Considerations:**
- Buy preserved meats (cheaper than fresh)
- Fresh beef luxury item
- Good time to buy dairy products (production increasing)

---

## SUMMER (Kythorn, Flamerule, Eleasis)
### June - August

**Cattle Activity:**
- Peak grazing (best grass growth)
- Rapid weight gain (young cattle)
- **Peak dairy production** (7-9 gallons/day possible)
- Steers fattening for fall processing

**Processing Activity:**
- **MODERATE** - Some processing for immediate consumption
- Culling non-breeding stock as they reach target weight
- Difficult in extreme heat (spoilage risk)

**Market Availability:**
- **Fresh Beef:** Good supply, stable pricing
- **Preserved Meats:** Stockpiles declining
- **Dairy:** PEAK AVAILABILITY (butter, cheese, milk abundant)

**Pricing:**
- Fresh beef: Baseline to +5%
- Preserved beef: +5-10% (stockpiles running low)
- Dairy products: LOWEST prices (peak production)

**Regional Variations:**
- **Southern regions (Amn, Calimshan):** Very limited processing (heat spoilage)
- **Northern regions:** Best processing season (cooler temperatures)
- **Coastal:** Moderate processing (sea breeze cooling)

**Player Considerations:**
- Good time to buy fresh beef
- Stock up on dairy products (cheap, abundant)
- Preserved meat prices rising (buy now if planning winter travel)

---

## FALL (Eleint, Marpenoth, Uktar)
### September - November

**Cattle Activity:**
- **PEAK PROCESSING SEASON** (harvest culling)
- Grass quality declining
- Cattle at maximum weight from summer grazing
- Farmers cull before winter (reduce feed costs)

**Processing Activity:**
- **MAXIMUM** - 60-70% of annual processing happens in fall
- Every butcher working overtime
- Community processing events common
- Preservation work intensive (smoking, curing for winter)

**Market Availability:**
- **Fresh Beef:** MAXIMUM supply (everywhere)
- **Preserved Meats:** Massive production (winter stockpiling)
- **Dairy:** Declining (cows dried off for winter)

**Pricing:**
- Fresh beef: LOWEST prices (-5 to -10%) - oversupply
- Live cattle (for immediate processing): Best buying prices
- Preserved beef: Baseline (fresh production)
- Dairy: Rising prices (production declining)

**Cultural Events:**
- **Harvest Festivals** include cattle processing
- Community processing (neighbors help neighbors)
- Smoking houses running 24/7
- Guild butchers hire temporary labor

**Player Considerations:**
- **BEST TIME TO BUY CATTLE** (if party has processing capability)
- Fresh beef abundant and cheap
- Stock up on preserved meats for winter travel
- Dairy products becoming scarce (buy now)

**Specific Timing:**
- **Early Fall (Eleint/September):** First processing wave, prices start dropping
- **Mid Fall (Marpenoth/October):** PEAK processing, lowest prices
- **Late Fall (Uktar/November):** Final processing before winter, prices rising

---

## WINTER (Nightal, Hammer, Alturiak)
### December - February

**Cattle Activity:**
- Survival mode (minimal grazing, hay feeding)
- Dairy production MINIMAL or stopped
- Breeding (spring calving preparations)
- NO processing (unless emergency)

**Processing Activity:**
- **MINIMAL to NONE** in most regions
- Only emergency culls (sick/injured)
- Southern regions (Amn) = some processing (milder winters)
- Northern regions (Icewind Dale) = ZERO processing (frozen conditions)

**Market Availability:**
- **Fresh Beef:** SCARCE (limited to recent culls)
- **Preserved Meats:** Primary supply (fall stockpiles)
- **Dairy:** MINIMAL (stored cheese/butter only)

**Pricing:**
- Fresh beef: PREMIUM (+20-30%) - extreme scarcity
- Preserved beef: Baseline to +10% (stockpiles depleting)
- Live cattle: NOT SOLD (breeding stock too valuable to cull)

**Regional Variations:**

**THE NORTH:**
- NO fresh beef available (everything frozen)
- Natural freezing = "preservation" (store meat frozen outside)
- Icewind Dale: Stockpiled frozen beef from fall lasts all winter
- Preserved meats primary option

**SWORD COAST:**
- Limited fresh beef (occasional culls)
- Preserved meats dominant
- Some import from southern regions (expensive)

**SOUTHERN REGIONS:**
- Some processing possible (mild winters)
- Fresh beef available but premium priced
- Best winter beef source for Western Faerûn

**Player Considerations:**
- Fresh beef luxury item (expensive, scarce)
- Rely on preserved meats for winter travel
- Plan provisions in fall (winter resupply difficult/expensive)
- Northern travel = bring preserved rations (no fresh available)

## BREED-SPECIFIC SEASONAL PATTERNS

**Dairy Cattle:**
- **Spring:** Calving, milk production rising
- **Summer:** Peak milk production
- **Fall:** Production declining, some cows culled
- **Winter:** Minimal/no production (dried off for calving)

**Beef Cattle:**
- **Spring:** Calving, grass growth
- **Summer:** Weight gain
- **Fall:** PROCESSING PEAK (maximum weight)
- **Winter:** Survival (no processing)

**Working Cattle:**
- **Spring/Summer:** Heavy work (plowing, hauling)
- **Fall:** Light work, some retirement culls
- **Winter:** Minimal work, NO culling (too valuable)

**Wild/Feral:**
- **Spring/Summer:** Hunting possible but not ideal (breeding, raising young)
- **Fall:** BEST HUNTING (maximum weight, ethical timing)
- **Winter:** Difficult hunting (animals scarce, weather harsh)

---

## PRESERVATION SEASONALITY

**When Different Preservation Methods Are Used:**

### **FALL - Primary Preservation Season**
- **Smoking:** Peak season (7-14 day process, cool weather ideal)
- **Curing:** Maximum activity (salt-curing, brining)
- **Drying:** Last chance before winter (jerky production)

### **WINTER**
- **Freezing:** Natural (northern regions)
- **Smoking:** Ongoing (cold weather = good smoke curing)
- **Cold Storage:** Snow/ice cellars

### **SPRING/SUMMER**
- **Quick Curing:** Speed essential (heat spoilage risk)
- **Immediate Consumption:** Fresh meat doesn't keep long
- **Magical Preservation:** Wealthy use ice magic (expensive)

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods** for techniques.

## GM TOOLKIT - SEASONAL SCENARIOS

**Spring:**
- "The town's meat stockpiles ran out early - pay premium for scarce beef or hunt?"
- "Local farmer's cow died during calving - emergency processing opportunity (cheap beef, low quality)"

**Summer:**
- "Heatwave threatens butcher's fresh inventory - discounted beef before it spoils"
- "Dairy surplus - local cheese festival with abundant cheap provisions"

**Fall:**
- "Harvest festival processing - community event, fresh beef everywhere, lowest prices"
- "Help local farmer process cattle in exchange for meat share"
- "Butcher hiring temporary labor for processing rush (quest opportunity)"

**Winter:**
- "Preserved beef only - adventurers planning northern travel must stock up now"
- "Blizzard cut off town - fresh beef worth premium to anyone who can hunt/process"
- "Smuggling fresh beef from southern regions (expensive, valuable cargo)"

---

## QUICK REFERENCE - WHEN TO BUY WHAT

**Best Time to Buy Fresh Beef:** Mid-Fall (Marpenoth/October)
**Best Time to Buy Preserved Beef:** Late Fall (Uktar/November) - fresh production
**Best Time to Buy Dairy:** Summer (Flamerule/July) - peak production
**Best Time to Buy Live Cattle:** Fall (before winter feed costs)
**Worst Time to Buy Fresh Beef:** Winter (Hammer/January) - scarcity pricing

**Best Time to Hunt Wild Cattle:** Fall (maximum weight, ethical)
**Worst Time to Hunt Wild Cattle:** Spring (breeding season, unethical)
