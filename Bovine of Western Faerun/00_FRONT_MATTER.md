## ABOUT THIS GUIDE

This guide applies universal bovine processing principles to the specific cattle breeds of Western Faerûn. Whether you're processing common Daggerford cattle for family meals or preparing premium Cormyrean beef for noble houses, the foundation remains constant - only the details vary.

**What This Guide Covers:**
- 16 cattle breeds across Western Faerûn
- Complete processing data, yields, and pricing
- Preservation methods adapted to each breed
- Regional preferences and cultural traditions
- Quick reference tables for field use

**What This Guide Assumes:**
You've read (or have access to) the foundation guides:
- **Master Butcher's Guide** - Universal processing techniques, safety protocols, economic mathematics
- **Master Provisioner's Guide** - Ingredient sourcing, preservation materials, storage methods

This guide builds on those foundations. We reference them frequently but don't repeat their content.

## HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

### **For Game Masters:**

Use this guide to:
- **Set realistic prices** for beef in your campaigns

- **Create quests** around cattle rustling, premium breeds, or dangerous wild bovine
- **Establish regional differences** in food culture

**Quick Reference:**
- Need beef prices? See breed profiles, "Retail Cuts & Pricing" sections
- Need processing time? See breed profiles, "Processing Time" sections
- Need cultural flavor? See breed profiles, "Cultural Notes" sections
- Need to compare breeds? See Appendix A: Breed Comparison Table

### **For Players:**

Use this guide to:
- **Know what you're buying** at markets

- **Make informed economic decisions** about meat purchases
- **Add realism** to survival, cooking, and provisioning activities

**Quick Reference:**
- Hunting aurochs or wild cattle? See Part 6: Wild & Feral Bovine

- Processing your kill? See Universal Bovine Cuts for basic yields
- Need preservation? See specific breed preservation recommendations

### **For Everyone:**

**Page Structure:**
Each breed profile follows the same format for easy comparison:
1. Quick Stats (at-a-glance breed information)
2. Physical Characteristics (appearance, size, temperament)
3. Yields & Processing (what you get, how long it takes)
4. Retail Cuts & Pricing (specific cuts and costs)
5. Purchase Pricing (live animal costs)
6. Preservation Methods (recommended techniques)
7. Quality Grading (typical grades for this breed)
8. Cultural Notes (regional use and traditions)
9. Foundation Cross-References (where to find more details)

**Cross-Reference System:**
- **§** = section reference (e.g., "See § Universal Bovine Cuts")
- **Bold section names** = exact section titles in referenced guides
- Page numbers omitted (use table of contents in each guide)

## GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE

This guide covers **Western Faerûn**, defined as:

**Primary Coverage:**
- **Sword Coast** - Waterdeep to Candlekeep
- **The North** - Neverwinter, Luskan, Icewind Dale
- **Western Heartlands** - Daggerford, Goldenfields, Trielta Hills
- **Amn & Tethyr** - Southern coastal regions
- **Calimshan** - Desert south
- **Cormyr & The Dales** - Eastern border of western Faerûn

**Why This Scope:**
Western Faerûn represents the most commercially developed, culturally diverse, and economically interconnected region of the continent. Trade routes link these areas, creating shared markets and cross-regional cattle movement. Most campaigns set in Faerûn will encounter these regions and their cattle breeds.

**Other Regions:**
Cattle breeds of **Eastern Faerûn** (Thay, Rashemen, Thesk), **Kara-Tur**, **Zakhara**, and **other continents** require separate guides due to different breeding traditions, climates, and cultural practices.

## PRICING BASELINE

All prices in this guide use **Waterdeep, 1492 DR** as the baseline.

**Currency:**
- **gp** = gold piece
- **sp** = silver piece (1 gp = 10 sp)
- **cp** = copper piece (1 sp = 10 cp)

**Regional Adjustments:**
Actual prices vary by region, season, and supply. General guidelines:
- **Origin regions:** -10% (direct from farmers)
- **Major trade hubs:** Baseline (Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate)
- **Northern markets:** +5-10% (longer supply chains)
- **Remote/frontier:** +20-40% (transportation costs, scarcity)
- **Desert south:** +15-25% (heat-adapted breeds, scarcity of cattle)

**Seasonal Adjustments:**
- **Fall:** Peak supply, baseline to -5%
- **Winter:** Limited supply, +15-25%
- **Spring:** Recovering supply, baseline
- **Summer:** Good supply, +5-10%

## INTEGRATION WITH FOUNDATION GUIDES

### **Master Butcher's Guide Integration**

This guide assumes you understand:
- **Universal processing techniques** (§ Processing Techniques)
- **Bovine family anatomy** (§ Animal Classification & Anatomy, Bovine Family)
- **Economic mathematics** (§ Economic Mathematics)
- **Preservation methods** (§ Preservation Methods)
- **Professional standards** (§ Professional Standards)
- **Safety protocols** (§ Safety Protocols throughout)

We apply those principles to specific breeds but don't re-teach them.

### **Master Provisioner's Guide Integration**

This guide references:
- **Preservation ingredients** (§ Herbs & Spices, § Salt Varieties)
- **Smoking woods** (§ Wood & Fuel)
- **Storage containers** (§ Storage & Containers)
- **Ingredient pricing** (throughout, for preservation cost calculations)

Helena's sourcing information ensures preservation methods are economically realistic.

## A NOTE ON REALISM VS. FANTASY

This guide strives for **grounded fantasy** - realistic enough to feel authentic, fantastic enough to remember we're in a magical world.

**Realistic Elements:**
- Yield percentages based on actual bovine anatomy
- Processing times reflecting real-world labor
- Economic calculations using sound business principles
- Preservation methods adapted from historical techniques

**Fantasy Elements:**
- Magical cooling extends aging capabilities
- Some breeds adapted to extreme climates (desert, arctic)
- Gorgons and other magical bovine-like creatures
- Occasional magical preservation techniques
- D&D currency and economic structures

**Our Philosophy:**
Players and GMs don't want fantasy economics that break immersion ("A cow costs 1 copper!") or real-world complexity that bogs down gameplay ("Calculate depreciation schedules for your butchering tools"). This guide aims for the middle path: realistic enough to feel authentic, simple enough to use at the table.

## SKILL REFERENCES

**D&D 5E Skills** that might apply when using this guide:

**Processing Cattle:**
- Survival (field dressing, basic processing)
- Medicine (recognizing disease, assessing quality)
- Nature (identifying breeds, understanding animal behavior)
- Artisan's Tools (Cook's Utensils, Brewer's Supplies for preservation)

**Buying/Selling Cattle:**
- Insight (detecting dishonest sellers)
- Persuasion (negotiating prices)
- Investigation (assessing quality before purchase)
- Animal Handling (evaluating live animals)

**GMs:** Set DCs based on task difficulty. Routine processing by an experienced NPC might require no roll. A PC attempting unfamiliar preservation techniques might need DC 15-20 checks.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

**To Helena Fairstock:**
Your provisioner's expertise grounds my butchering knowledge in economic reality. Your ingredient sourcing makes my preservation methods possible.

**To the International Butcher's Guild:**
132 years across four continents taught me that every culture butchers cattle slightly differently - and every method has value.

**To Western Faerûn's Cattle Farmers:**
From Icewind Dale to Calimshan, you raise the animals that feed civilization. This guide honors your work by ensuring nothing is wasted and everything is processed with skill and respect.

## HOW THIS GUIDE WAS COMPILED

Over 132 years, I've processed cattle across Faerûn and beyond:
- Common Daggerford cattle for working families
- Premium Cormyrean stock for noble tables
- Hardy northern breeds in frozen Icewind Dale
- Desert-adapted Calishite cattle in scorching heat
- Wild aurochs in frontier regions
- And yes, one gorgon (never again)

This guide distills that experience into practical information for anyone working with Western Faerûnian cattle.

Helena contributed sourcing information, pricing data, and preservation ingredient specifications based on 32 years of provisioning across the Sword Coast.

Together, we've created a comprehensive reference for professional butchers, traveling merchants, frontier settlers, and anyone else who needs to understand cattle processing in Western Faerûn.
