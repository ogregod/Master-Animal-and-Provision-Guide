# HIGH MOOR SCRUB CATTLE
## Semi-Feral Frontier Survivors

*Between domestic cattle and wild aurochs lie the scrub cattle of the High Moor and frontier regions. Descended from abandoned farm stock, they've adapted to harsh wilderness survival. Smaller, tougher, and wary of humans - but providing essential beef to remote settlements where traditional cattle cannot survive.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## YIELDS & PROCESSING

### **Standard Processing (950 lb steer - hunted)**

```
Live Weight: 950 lbs
↓ (59% dressing - lean, minimal fat)
Dressed: 560 lbs
↓ (10 days aging - shorter, frontier processing)
Aged: 537 lbs
↓ (36.5% retail - lean but efficient)
Retail Cuts: 196 lbs

Total Yield: 20.6% (low due to lean, wild condition)
```

### **Processing Time**

**Total Active Labor:** 10-12 hours average (shorter - wild game method)

**Timeline:**
- **Field dressing:** 1-2 hours (on-site, wilderness conditions)
- Transport to processing location
- Aging: 10 days (shorter for wild game)
- Primal breakdown: 2 hours
- Retail fabrication: 5-7 hours (smaller animal, lean meat)

**Labor Cost:** ~48 sp (12 hours × 4 sp/hour journeyman rate)

**Note:** Field dressing is HUNTER labor (not butcher labor). Butcher processing begins after transport. If hunter cannot field dress, add +20 sp for butcher to travel to kill site.

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Economic Mathematics, Labor Cost Calculations**

**Field Processing:** Often field-dressed immediately (wilderness hunting conditions)

---

## CULTURAL NOTES

**Frontier Tradition:** Hunting scrub cattle = essential frontier skill
**Wild Character:** Treated as wild game, not domestic livestock
**Respectful Hunting:** Not sport - subsistence hunting only
**Complete Use:** Frontier code = waste nothing

**Processing:** Community effort (large animal, limited resources)

**Regional Pride:** "High Moor beef" considered superior to city-bought meat (debatable, but frontier belief)

---

## HUNTING & PROCESSING

**Hunting Methods:**
- Tracking and stalking (like deer hunting)
- Rounding up into makeshift corrals
- Bow/crossbow preferred (quieter, less spooking herd)

**Dangers:**
- Defensive horns (can gore hunters)
- Herd defense behavior
- Wilderness predators attracted to kill

**Field Dressing:** Required within 2-4 hours (wilderness conditions, no refrigeration)

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Processing Techniques, Field Dressing & Wild Game** for complete methods.

---

## PRESERVATION METHODS

**Frontier Techniques:**
- **Smoking** (primary method, 7-14 days)
- **Jerky** (travel rations, long storage)
- **Salting** (emergency preservation)
- **Immediate consumption** (community feast after successful hunt)

**Challenge:** Limited preservation resources in frontier (salt expensive, smoking wood gathered)

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods, Frontier & Wilderness Techniques** for complete methods.
