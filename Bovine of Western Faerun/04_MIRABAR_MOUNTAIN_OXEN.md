# MIRABAR MOUNTAIN OXEN
## Northern Mining & Mountain Draft Cattle

*In the frozen mountains around Mirabar, these massive oxen haul ore wagons, supply sleds, and mining equipment through terrain that would break lesser animals. Bred for strength and cold tolerance, they work 10-15 years before culling. The toughest, most substantial beef in the North.*

**— Thadius Del Irontet, Master Butcher**

## YIELDS & PROCESSING

### **Typical Cull Ox (1,900 lb, 12 years old)**

```
Live Weight: 1,900 lbs
↓ (56% dressing - very low, extreme work/age)
Dressed: 1,064 lbs
↓ (14 days aging - minimal for very tough meat)
Aged: 1,022 lbs
↓ (33% retail - significant waste from worked muscles)
Retail Cuts: 337 lbs

Total Yield: 17.7% (LOWEST of domestic cattle)
```

### **Processing Time**

**Total Active Labor:** 19-20 hours average (LONGEST of any domestic cattle)

**Timeline:**
- Initial processing: 4-5 hours (slaughter to hung - MASSIVE animal, 1,900 lbs)
- Aging: 14 days (minimal - very tough meat)
- Primal breakdown: 4-5 hours (extremely heavy carcass, requires multiple butchers)
- Retail fabrication: 9-11 hours (large volume, extensive connective tissue trimming)

**Labor Cost:** ~100 sp (20 hours × 5 sp/hour experienced journeyman/low master rate)

**Note:** Mirabar Mountain Oxen are DIFFICULT to process - some butchers refuse them. Standard journeyman rate (4 sp/hour) insufficient for this work. Expect 5-6 sp/hour for experienced butchers willing to handle these massive animals.

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Economic Mathematics, Labor Cost Calculations**

**Why so low?** Oldest animals, most heavily worked muscles, extreme connective tissue development.

## PRESERVATION METHODS

**Northern Techniques:**
- **Cold smoking** (4-6 weeks, tenderizes heavily)
- **Heavy salt-curing** (breaks down tough connective tissue)
- **Dried/jerked beef** (lean cuts, long storage)
- **Natural freezing** (winter months, no processing needed)

**Optimal:** Long, slow preservation methods that tenderize during cure

**See Master Butcher's Guide § Preservation Methods, Northern Techniques** for complete instructions.
