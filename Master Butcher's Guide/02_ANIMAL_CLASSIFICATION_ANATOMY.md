# ANIMAL CLASSIFICATION & ANATOMY
## Universal Framework for Understanding All Creature Families

*In 132 years of butchering, I've learned that every creature - from field mice to ancient dragons - follows predictable anatomical patterns and processing yields. The mathematics of butchering are unforgiving: what goes in must be accounted for completely. Understanding these patterns and realistic yield expectations means you can approach any new creature with confidence, knowing exactly what to expect and how to price your work accordingly.*

## FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF PROFESSIONAL BUTCHERING

### **The Butchering Process Is Sequential**
Every animal follows the same processing sequence: Live Weight → Hot Carcass Weight → Hang Weight → Aged Weight → Retail Cut Weight. Each step has predictable losses that must be calculated into pricing. Skip any step, and your yields will disappoint.

### **Hang Time Is Not Optional**
Proper aging improves tenderness and flavor but costs weight through moisture loss. Fourteen days minimum for most animals, twenty-one days for large, tough creatures. During aging, expect 3-7% weight loss from dehydration. This isn't waste—it's improvement.

### **Realistic Yields Are Lower Than Expected**
After 132 years, I still see customers shocked by actual meat yields. A 1,200-pound steer yields about 470 pounds of retail cuts—39% of live weight. The remaining 61% becomes bones, hide, organs, fat, waste, and processing losses. Plan accordingly.

### **Size Determines Efficiency**
Larger animals process more efficiently than smaller ones. A tiny creature might yield only 25% retail cuts due to handling losses, while a gargantuan creature can yield 50%. The mathematics of scale favor volume processing.

### **Family Patterns Are Predictable**
Canines share muscle patterns whether they're domesticated dogs or dire wolves. Felines have similar bone structures from house cats to displacer beasts. Bears follow the same fat distribution patterns from cubs to dire bears. Learn the family, understand all members.

### **All Parts Must Be Accounted For**
Professional butchering means accounting for 100% of live weight. Retail cuts, bones, hide, organs, blood, fat, waste, processing losses—everything has a destination. Incomplete accounting leads to pricing errors and disappointed customers.

### **Magic Adds Complexity, Not Impossibility**
Magical creatures follow normal anatomy plus magical additions. A winter wolf has normal wolf anatomy plus magical cold organs. A phoenix has bird anatomy plus regeneration components. Start with the base anatomy, identify the magical additions, adapt standard techniques.

## THE PROFESSIONAL BUTCHERING PROCESS

### **Understanding the Processing Flow**
Every animal, regardless of size or species, follows the same processing sequence. Understanding this flow is critical for accurate yield calculations and customer expectations:

**1. Live Weight (100%)**
- The creature as killed
- Includes all body contents, organs, blood, and materials
- Used as baseline for all calculations

**2. Hot Carcass Weight (55-75% of live weight)**
- After removal of hide, head, organs, blood, and feet
- Still warm from processing
- Immediate weight after initial breakdown

**3. Hang Weight (50-70% of live weight)**
- Carcass prepared for aging
- What most processors use for pricing
- Ready for temperature-controlled aging

**4. Aged Weight (48-68% of live weight)**
- After 14-21 days of aging
- 3-7% moisture loss during aging improves tenderness
- Ready for final breakdown into retail cuts

**5. Retail Cut Weight (25-50% of live weight)**
- Final packaged meat ready for consumption
- After removal of bones, excess fat, and final trimming
- What customers actually receive

### **Hang Time and Aging Process**
Proper aging is not optional for quality meat:

**Minimum Aging Times:**
- **Small creatures (under 50 lbs):** 3-7 days
- **Medium creatures (50-500 lbs):** 14-21 days  
- **Large creatures (500+ lbs):** 21-28 days
- **Magical creatures:** Varies by magical properties

**Aging Environment Requirements:**
- **Temperature:** 34-38°F (just above freezing)
- **Humidity:** 85-90% to prevent excessive drying
- **Air circulation:** Controlled airflow prevents spoilage
- **Cleanliness:** Sterile environment prevents contamination

**Weight Loss During Aging:**
- **Standard loss:** 3-5% of hang weight
- **Extended aging:** Up to 7% loss for premium quality
- **Poor conditions:** Can lose 10%+ to spoilage
- **Magical preservation:** Can reduce loss to 1-2%

- **Bones:** 20% (30 lbs) - may be useful for tools after purification
- **Organs:** 5% (7.5 lbs) - usually non-functional
- **Processing Loss:** 5% (7.5 lbs) - decay and contamination

**ABSOLUTE SAFETY WARNING:**
- **NO UNDEAD MEAT IS SAFE FOR CONSUMPTION**
- **Negative energy contamination throughout all tissues**
- **Disease and decay risks to processors**
- **Magical contamination affects all preservation attempts**

**Legitimate Processing Applications:**
- Proper consecration and disposal of undead remains
- Component harvesting for clerical/magical research
- Evidence collection for undead-related investigations
- Academic study of undeath processes

**Required Safety Protocols:**
1. **Consecrated tools required** (prevents re-animation)
2. **Full protective equipment** (contamination prevention)
3. **Magical purification** throughout process
4. **Immediate disposal** of all contaminated materials
5. **Professional clerical oversight** strongly recommended

**Economic Reality:**
Undead processing is specialized hazard work requiring clerical support, magical equipment, and substantial hazard pay. Limited to component harvesting and proper disposal rather than any food production.

### **ELEMENTAL FAMILY - MAGICAL COMPONENT HARVESTING**
*Fire, water, earth, air elementals*
**⚠️ NOT TRADITIONAL BUTCHERING ⚠️**

**Professional Assessment (200 lb Fire Elemental):**
- **Edible Meat:** 0% (not biological material)
- **Fire Essence:** 80% (160 lbs equivalent) - magical component
- **Elemental Core:** 15% (30 lbs equivalent) - extremely valuable
- **Ash Residue:** 5% (10 lbs) - alchemical applications

**Processing Notes by Element:**

**Fire Elementals:**
- Extreme heat protection required throughout processing
- Fire essence valuable for magical applications
- Ash residue useful for alchemical work
- No food value whatsoever

**Water Elementals:**
- Specialized containment required to maintain coherence
- Purified magical water for potions and rituals
- Essence may evaporate if not properly contained

**Earth Elementals:**
- Processing resembles mining more than butchering
- Rare minerals and crystalline structures primary value
- Heavy-duty tools required for stone/metal work

**Air Elementals:**
- Extreme difficulty containing gaseous forms
- Vacuum vessels required for bottling magical gases
- Components valuable for alchemical applications

**Professional Reality:**
Elemental "processing" requires specialized magical knowledge and equipment. Better handled by alchemists or magical specialists rather than traditional butchers. No food applications whatsoever.

## UNIVERSAL PROCESSING PRINCIPLES

### **The Template System for Unknown Creatures**

When encountering new or unfamiliar creatures, use this systematic approach:

**Step 1: Basic Classification**
- **Primary Family:** What animal family does this most resemble?
- **Size Category:** Tiny through Gargantuan classification
- **Body Type:** Lean predator, fatty omnivore, herbivore, etc.
- **Magical Properties:** None, minor, significant, or major magical aspects

**Step 2: Baseline Estimation**
- **Start with closest family percentages** as initial estimate
- **Apply size category modifiers** for processing efficiency
- **Adjust for body condition** (fat, lean, athletic, etc.)
- **Factor in magical considerations** if applicable

**Step 3: Anatomical Assessment**
- **Examine actual anatomy** versus expected patterns
- **Identify unique features** requiring special handling
- **Locate any dangerous elements** (venom, magic, toxins)
- **Plan processing sequence** based on findings

**Step 4: Processing Modifications**
- **Adapt tools and techniques** as needed
- **Modify safety protocols** for identified hazards
- **Adjust timing estimates** for complexity
- **Plan for specialty component handling**

**Step 5: Economic Calculations**
- **Calculate realistic yields** based on findings
- **Factor processing difficulty** into labor costs
- **Assess market values** for all components
- **Determine profitability** and pricing structure

### **Yield Calculation Formulas**

**Basic Live Weight Conversions:**
```
Hang Weight = Live Weight × Family Dressing Percentage
Aged Weight = Hang Weight × (1 - Aging Loss Percentage)  
Retail Weight = Live Weight × Family Retail Percentage
```

**Size Scaling Adjustments:**
```
Adjusted Retail % = Base Family % + Size Modifier
- Tiny: Base% - 15%
- Small: Base% - 7%  
- Medium: Base% (no modifier)
- Large: Base% + 3%
- Huge: Base% + 6%
- Gargantuan: Base% + 8%
```

**Processing Time Estimates:**
```
Estimated Time = Base Family Time × (Creature Weight ÷ Family Standard Weight)^0.75
× Complexity Modifier × Size Efficiency Factor
```

**Economic Break-Even Calculations:**
```
Minimum Selling Price = (Processing Costs + Creature Cost + Overhead) ÷ Expected Yield
Target Price = Minimum Price ÷ (1 - Desired Profit Margin)
```

## MAGICAL CREATURE PROCESSING CONSIDERATIONS

### **Magical Organ Detection and Assessment**

**Pre-Processing Protocol:**
1. **Cast *Detect Magic*** on entire carcass
2. **Map all magical auras** and intensity levels
3. **Identify magical organ locations** using specialized detection
4. **Assess safety risks** from magical properties
5. **Plan processing sequence** to preserve magical components

**Magical Component Categories:**

**Stable Magical Components:**
- Magic persists indefinitely after death
- Standard processing with magical tools
- Require magical preservation methods
- Examples: Dragon glands, phoenix hearts, unicorn horns

**Volatile Magical Components:**
- Magic degrades rapidly after death (hours)
- Immediate processing absolutely required
- Specialized magical preservation essential
- Examples: Temporal organs, divination centers, elemental cores

**Dangerous Magical Components:**
- Harmful magical effects persist after death
- Extreme safety protocols required
- May require containment rather than processing
- Examples: Medusa organs, cursed parts, toxic magical glands

**Living Magical Components:**
- Continue functioning after creature death
- May require special deactivation procedures
- Often impossible to preserve functionality
- Examples: Regeneration organs, animation cores, symbiotic components

### **Magical Preservation Requirements**

**Standard Magical Preservation:**
- ***Gentle Repose*** prevents decay while maintaining magical properties
- **Magical cold storage** provides controlled environment
- **Stasis fields** offer temporary time suspension
- **Enhanced curing salts** with magical properties

**Specialized Preservation:**
- **Element-specific containers** for elemental organs
- **Null magic storage** suppresses dangerous effects
- **Temporal stasis chambers** stop degradation completely
- **Life support systems** maintain living magical organs

### **Economic Value of Magical Components**

Magical components often exceed meat value by orders of magnitude:
- **Dragon breath glands:** 500-2,000 gp each
- **Phoenix feathers:** 100-500 gp each  
- **Unicorn horn:** 1,000-5,000 gp
- **Basilisk eyes:** 200-800 gp per pair

Factor magical component values into total creature economics—sometimes the magical parts drive the entire processing decision.

## PROFESSIONAL FINAL NOTES

After 132 years of butchering everything from field mice to ancient dragons, these principles have served me consistently:

**Realistic Expectations Save Relationships:** Customers who expect 70% meat yield from a 1,000-pound horse will be disappointed. Educate them with realistic numbers from the start.

**Complete Accounting Prevents Losses:** Every ounce of live weight goes somewhere. Account for all of it in your pricing, or you'll lose money on hidden costs.

**Safety Protocols Are Not Optional:** One contamination incident or processing injury can end a career. Follow safety protocols religiously, especially with magical or dangerous creatures.

**Quality Over Quantity:** Better to process fewer creatures well than many creatures poorly. Your reputation depends on consistent quality.

**Know Your Limits:** If a creature requires processing techniques you haven't mastered, refer the work to appropriate specialists. Better to pass on profit than risk failure.

**Every Creature Teaches Something:** Even after 132 years, I still learn from unusual anatomy, unexpected magical properties, or novel processing challenges. Stay curious, stay careful.

This framework will serve you whether you're processing your first rabbit or your hundredth dragon. The principles scale, the mathematics remain consistent, and the respect for both the craft and the creature never changes.
