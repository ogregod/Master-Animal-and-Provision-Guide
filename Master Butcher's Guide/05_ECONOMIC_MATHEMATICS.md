# ECONOMIC MATHEMATICS
## Pricing Formulas and Business Calculations for Professional Operations

*Numbers don't lie, and customers don't pay for sentiment. In 132 years across four continents, I've learned that butchering is ultimately a business. You can have perfect technique, the sharpest tools, and the finest preservation methods - but if you can't price your work to cover costs and generate profit, you'll be closing your doors within a year. Every cut has a value, every minute of labor costs money, and every piece of equipment must pay for itself. These are the mathematical foundations that turn craftsmanship into livelihood.*

## FOUNDATIONAL PRICING PRINCIPLES

### **The Universal Truth of Butchering Economics**

**Cost Control Determines Success:** You can't control market prices, but you can control costs
**Time Is Money:** Every minute spent processing must be accounted for in pricing
**Quality Commands Premium:** Superior work justifies higher prices
**Consistency Builds Reputation:** Reliable pricing builds customer trust

### **The Three-Layer Pricing System**

Every piece of meat you sell has three cost components that must be recovered:

**1. Material Costs (40-60% of final price)**
- Live animal purchase price
- Processing supplies (salt, spices, wrapping materials)
- Preservation materials (wood, magical components)

**2. Labor Costs (20-30% of final price)**
- Processing time at appropriate skill rates
- Specialized technique premiums
- Quality control and finishing work

**3. Overhead Costs (15-25% of final price)**
- Equipment depreciation and maintenance
- Facility costs (rent, utilities, maintenance)
- Professional fees (guild dues, magical consultations)
- Business operations (record keeping, customer service)

**Profit Margin: 10-20%** (varies by market conditions and competition)

## UNIVERSAL CUT CLASSIFICATION & PRICING HIERARCHY

This hierarchy applies to all creatures - the specific multipliers adapt based on the animal, but the relative relationships remain constant.

### **PREMIUM TIER CUTS (300-500% of base meat price)**

**Characteristics:** 
- Exceptional tenderness and flavor
- Limited quantity per animal (2-8% of retail cuts)
- High skill required for proper preparation
- Commands luxury market pricing

**Examples:**
- **Tenderloin:** Most tender cut from any animal
- **Prime Rib/Loin:** Central back cuts with optimal marbling
- **Delicacy Cuts:** Species-specific premium parts (tongue, certain organs)

**Pricing Formula:**
```
Premium Cut Price = Base Meat Price × 3.0 to 5.0 × Quality Modifier × Rarity Modifier
```

**Labor Premium:** +50% standard processing time due to precision required

---

### **CHOICE TIER CUTS (150-250% of base meat price)**

**Characteristics:**
- Good tenderness with proper preparation
- Moderate quantity per animal (15-22% of retail cuts)
- Standard professional skills sufficient
- Appeals to middle and upper-middle market

**Examples:**
- **Steaks:** Various cuts from hindquarter and loin
- **Roasts:** Large cooking pieces from prime areas
- **Chops:** Individual rib or loin portions

**Pricing Formula:**
```
Choice Cut Price = Base Meat Price × 1.5 to 2.5 × Quality Modifier × Local Demand
```

**Labor Standard:** Base processing time rates

---

### **STANDARD TIER CUTS (100-140% of base meat price)**

**Characteristics:**
- Good eating with appropriate cooking methods
- Substantial quantity per animal (35-42% of retail cuts)
- Basic skills sufficient for processing
- Everyday market - consistent demand

**Examples:**
- **Shoulder Cuts:** Tougher cuts requiring longer cooking
- **Round Cuts:** Lean cuts from rear legs
- **Breast Cuts:** Front portions, variable tenderness

**Pricing Formula:**
```
Standard Cut Price = Base Meat Price × 1.0 to 1.4 × Volume Discount × Processing Efficiency
```

**Labor Efficiency:** Can often batch process for lower per-unit costs

---

### **UTILITY TIER CUTS (60-90% of base meat price)**

**Characteristics:**
- Requires special preparation (grinding, stewing, curing)
- High quantity per animal (25-30% of retail cuts)
- Minimal skill required but time-intensive
- Price-sensitive market segment

**Examples:**
- **Ground Meat:** Various fat ratios and applications
- **Stew Cuts:** Small pieces for long cooking methods
- **Soup Bones:** Bone-in cuts for stock and broth

**Pricing Formula:**
```
Utility Cut Price = Base Meat Price × 0.6 to 0.9 × Processing Cost Offset × Volume Bonus
```

**Labor Considerations:** High volume processing reduces per-unit labor costs

---

## LABOR COST CALCULATIONS

### **Skill-Based Hourly Rates (1492 DR Standard)**

**Apprentice Level (Years 1-7):**
- **Base Rate:** 2 sp per hour
- **Capabilities:** Basic cuts, standard procedures
- **Supervision Required:** 25% master time for oversight
- **Efficiency:** 70-80% of master speed

**Journeyman Level (Years 8-20):**
- **Base Rate:** 4 sp per hour  
- **Capabilities:** Complex cuts, customer interaction
- **Supervision Required:** Minimal for routine work
- **Efficiency:** 90-100% of master speed

**Master Level (Years 21+):**
- **Base Rate:** 8 sp per hour
- **Capabilities:** All cuts, magical creatures, training others
- **Premium Services:** Exotic creatures, cultural specialties
- **Efficiency:** 100% standard, plus quality premiums

### **Time Estimates by Processing Complexity**

**Basic Processing (Common Livestock):**
- **Small Animals (Under 50 lbs):** 1-2 hours total processing
- **Medium Animals (50-200 lbs):** 3-5 hours total processing  
- **Large Animals (200-500 lbs):** 6-10 hours total processing
- **Very Large Animals (500-800 lbs):** 12-20 hours total processing (1-2 days)
- **Massive Creatures (800+ lbs):** 24-72 hours total processing (2-3+ days with team processing)

**Advanced Processing (Exotic/Magical Creatures):**
- **Add 50-100%** to basic time for unusual anatomy
- **Add 25-50%** for magical component extraction
- **Add 100%** for dangerous creature safety protocols

**Preservation Processing:**
- **Add 2-4 hours** for smoking preparation and monitoring
- **Add 1-2 hours** for salt curing setup and inspection
- **Add 3-6 hours** for complex spice treatments

### **Labor Cost Formula**

```
Total Labor Cost = (Processing Hours × Skill Rate) + (Supervision Hours × Master Rate) + Complexity Premium
```

**Example Calculation:**
Medium pig (150 lbs), Journeyman processing, standard bacon preparation:
- Processing time: 4 hours
- Skill rate: 4 sp/hour
- Supervision: None needed
- Preservation: +2 hours for bacon prep
- **Total: (4 + 2) × 4 sp = 24 sp labor cost**
