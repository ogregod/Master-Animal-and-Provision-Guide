# PRESERVATION METHODS
## Keeping Meat Safe, Profitable, and Valuable Across All Climates

*Preservation separates professionals from amateurs. Any butcher can cut meat - but keeping it safe, flavorful, and profitable for days, weeks, or months requires real knowledge. I've spent 132 years learning preservation techniques from desert nomads in Zakhara who cure meat in shifting sands, to Kozakuran masters who preserve through seasonal harmony, to Thayan necromancers who stop decay through controlled death magic. Every climate, every culture, every creature requires different approaches. The principles are universal, but the applications are as diverse as Toril itself.*

## UNIVERSAL PRESERVATION PRINCIPLES

### **The Four Foundations of Meat Preservation**

**Moisture Control:** Remove or bind water to prevent spoilage and decay
**Temperature Control:** Cold slows decay, heat kills pathogens, combinations preserve
**Chemical Protection:** Salt, acid, smoke compounds that inhibit spoilage
**Environmental Barriers:** Casings, wax, storage containers that exclude contamination

Every preservation method uses one or more of these principles. Understanding how they work allows you to adapt techniques to any creature, any climate, any situation.

### **The Mathematics of Preservation**

**Base Rule:** Fresh meat spoils in 1-3 days at room temperature
**Goal:** Extend storage life to weeks, months, or years while maintaining quality
**Trade-off:** Preservation always changes texture, flavor, or both
**Economics:** Preserved meat commands different prices than fresh - sometimes higher, sometimes lower

**Yield Calculations for Preservation:**
- **Salt curing:** 15-25% weight loss from moisture removal
- **Smoking:** 20-30% weight loss plus labor and fuel costs
- **Drying:** 60-75% weight loss but concentrates flavor and nutrition
- **Magical preservation:** Variable cost but minimal weight loss

## REGIONAL PRESERVATION MASTERY ACROSS TORIL

### **FAERÛNIAN TRADITIONAL METHODS**

#### **Northern Preservation (Icewind Dale, Silverymoon, Neverwinter)**

**Cold Smoking Techniques:**
*Learned from guild masters in the Silver Marches*

**Process:** 
1. Salt cure for 24-48 hours depending on cut thickness
2. Rinse and air-dry until pellicle forms (8-12 hours)
3. Cold smoke at below body temperature for 12-72 hours
4. Final curing in cool, dry storage

**Wood Selection by Region:**
- **Apple:** Sweet, mild smoke - excellent for poultry and pork
- **Maple:** Delicate flavor - preferred for fish and game birds
- **Oak:** Strong, traditional - standard for beef and large game
- **Birch:** Sharp, distinctive - favored by northern hunters

**Temperature Control:**
- **Smoking chamber:** Cool to touch but warm enough for wood to smolder
- **Air circulation:** Critical - stagnant air causes spoilage
- **Weather adaptation:** High humidity requires longer drying time

**Results:**
- **Storage life:** 2-6 months depending on cut size
- **Weight loss:** 25-30% during full process
- **Market value:** Premium pricing for properly smoked products
