## ABOUT THIS GUIDE

In my three centuries of life, I've learned that taking a life - whether for sustenance or defense - is not something done lightly. But when it's done, it should be done well. Every creature deserves to be processed with skill, respect, and efficiency. Nothing should be wasted.

I've spent 132 years cutting meat. Thirteen of those were in the field, processing everything from dire wolves to owlbears while my adventuring companions argued about trap mechanisms and ancient curses. The last 119 years have been learning the craft across four continents - from Waterdeep guild halls to Calishite spice houses, from Kozakuran precision workshops to Chultan jungle processing stations - studying under masters who knew their regional techniques inside and out.

This guide isn't for dilettantes who want to play at being butchers. It's for professionals who understand that feeding people properly means knowing your business from snout to tail. No romantic nonsense about "honoring the spirit" - though respect is fundamental - this is practical knowledge for people who need to process animals efficiently without waste or spoilage.

## WHO THIS GUIDE IS FOR

**Professional Butchers**
Whether you're starting out or have decades of experience, this guide provides the mathematical foundations and technical knowledge needed to process any creature efficiently and profitably.

**Tavern & Inn Keepers**
You need to understand yield calculations, cut specifications, and preservation methods. When you buy a whole pig, you need to know exactly what you're getting and how to use every part.

**Army Cooks & Quartermasters**
Field processing is different from shop work. You need to know how to break down animals quickly with minimal tools while maintaining food safety for hundreds of soldiers.

**Adventuring Parties**
When you kill something that's not trying to kill you back, you need to process it properly. Field dressing, preservation without cold storage, and maximizing nutrition per pound of pack weight.

**Ship's Cooks**
Long voyages require understanding which cuts preserve best, how to process sea creatures, and managing protein stores in humid conditions.

**Noble House Kitchen Masters**
Your employers expect variety and quality. You need to know premium cuts, exotic creature processing, and presentation techniques that justify the expense.

**Hunters & Trappers**
Whether you're taking game animals or dealing with bounties on dangerous creatures, proper processing determines whether your work is profitable or wasteful.

**Anyone Who Processes Animals for Food**
From a family homestead to a large commercial operation, the principles are universal: efficient breakdown, minimal waste, proper preservation, and safe handling.

## WHAT MAKES THIS GUIDE DIFFERENT

**Honest Experience**
I've processed everything from field mice to adult dragons. I know what works in practice versus what sounds good in theory. I've made every mistake worth making - some of them expensive, others nearly fatal.

**Mathematical Precision**
Every yield percentage is based on verified measurements. When I say a medium pig provides 65% retail cuts, that's from processing hundreds of pigs with careful weight tracking. No guesswork.

**Anatomical Reality**
Animals don't read textbooks. Real creatures have variations, damage, disease, and unexpected anatomy. I teach you how to adapt when reality doesn't match the ideal.

**Universal Principles**
Rather than memorizing specific instructions for 2,500 different creatures, you'll learn the underlying principles that apply to all animal families. Then you can adapt to whatever walks, flies, or crawls through your door.

**Economic Integration**
This guide connects directly to Helena Fairstock's excellent *Master Provisioner's Guide*. I reference her pricing and sourcing information for tools, preservatives, and supplies. No point duplicating good work.

**Safety First**
In 132 years, I've seen butchers lose fingers to poor technique, die from infected cuts, and poison customers with spoiled meat. I include every safety protocol worth knowing, often learned the hard way.

**Regional Knowledge**
I've worked from Icewind Dale to Calimshan, learning regional preferences, local techniques, and what sells where. Climate, culture, and available resources all affect processing decisions.

## UNDERSTANDING CREATURE SIZE CATEGORIES

Size affects everything - processing time, yield ratios, equipment needs, and storage requirements. The standard categories are:

**Tiny** (2½ ft. or smaller) - Field mice, ravens, stirges
*Processing time: 5-15 minutes, specialized tools needed*

**Small** (2½-5 ft.) - Halflings, small dogs, giant rats
*Processing time: 30-60 minutes, standard tools sufficient*

**Medium** (5-10 ft.) - Humans, horses, large wolves
*Processing time: 2-4 hours, full shop setup recommended*

**Large** (10-15 ft.) - Ogres, young dragons, owlbears
*Processing time: 6-12 hours, heavy equipment required*

**Huge** (15-30 ft.) - Adult dragons, giants, purple worms
*Processing time: 1-3 days, specialized facilities needed*

**Gargantuan** (30+ ft.) - Ancient dragons, krakens, tarrasques
*Processing time: 1-2 weeks, industrial operation required*

Each size category requires different approaches, tools, and facilities. A technique that works for processing a deer won't scale to processing a dragon.

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLES FOR BUTCHERS

### 1. **Respect the Sacrifice**
Every creature gave its life - whether willingly or not. Honor that sacrifice by using every part possible. Waste is disrespectful to the creature and wasteful of your time and investment.

### 2. **Sharp Tools Save Lives**
A dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one. Dull blades slip, require more pressure, and cause ragged cuts that heal poorly. Keep your tools sharp, clean, and properly maintained.

### 3. **Speed Prevents Spoilage**
From the moment of death, spoilage begins. Cold slows it, but processing speed prevents it. Learn to work quickly and efficiently without sacrificing quality.

### 4. **Know Your Anatomy**
You can't butcher what you don't understand. Learn muscle groups, joint locations, organ placement, and bone structure. This knowledge determines efficiency and yield.

### 5. **Temperature Control Is Everything**
Meat spoils fast in warm conditions. Keep everything as cold as possible throughout processing. Hot days mean early starts or magical cooling.

### 6. **Sanitation Prevents Disease**
Clean tools, clean surfaces, clean hands, clean water. Cross-contamination kills customers and destroys businesses. Make cleanliness automatic.

### 7. **Calculate Real Costs**
Live weight isn't retail weight. Processing time has value. Storage costs money. Spoilage destroys profits. Factor everything into your pricing.

### 8. **Plan for Variation**
No two creatures are identical. Injuries, age, diet, magical exposure - all affect processing. Prepare for deviations from the standard.

## A NOTE ON MAGICAL CREATURES

Many creatures in our world possess magical properties. This affects processing in several ways:

**Magical Organs**: Some organs retain magical properties after death and are extremely valuable. Proper extraction and preservation techniques are critical.

**Dangerous Components**: Some magical parts are actively harmful to handle. Dragon bile, medusa blood, certain magical glands - know what's dangerous before you cut into it.

**Enhanced Preservation**: Some magical creatures naturally resist decay or have parts that preserve longer than normal. This affects processing timelines and storage requirements.

**Market Value**: Magical components command premium prices but also attract premium scrutiny. Buyers will verify authenticity. Fakes are not just unprofitable - they're dangerous to your reputation.

**Legal Restrictions**: Some magical creatures are protected, some parts are controlled substances, and some sales require special licenses. Know the law.

Always verify magical properties before processing. A *Detect Magic* spell costs much less than processing a creature incorrectly or missing valuable components.

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING GUIDES

This guide works in partnership with Helena Fairstock's *Master Provisioner's Guide*. Her work is excellent - thorough, accurate, and honest. I reference her pricing and sourcing information throughout this guide rather than duplicate her efforts.

**For Equipment & Tools**: Helena covers basic cooking equipment, preservation supplies, and many tools used in butchering. I focus on specialized butchering equipment and expand on her foundation.

**For Preservation Ingredients**: Salt varieties, smoking woods, spices for curing - Helena's guide is authoritative. I explain their application in meat processing.

**For Storage & Facilities**: General storage principles are the same whether you're storing grain or meat. Helena's storage recommendations apply to processed meat products.

**For Economic Principles**: Business mathematics, supplier relationships, customer service - the fundamentals are universal. Good business practices work for provisioners and butchers alike.

## ABOUT THE AUTHOR

**Thadius Del Irontet** has spent 132 years mastering the butcher's trade across four continents. He began as an adventurer at age 192 - young for a Firbolg - spending thirteen years processing creatures in field conditions while his companions explored ancient ruins and battled monsters from the Underdark to the peaks of distant mountains.

At 205, he transitioned to professional butchering, beginning his formal apprenticeship in Waterdeep despite his extensive field experience. Shop work requires different skills than field processing, and he spent seven years learning proper techniques, tool use, and business practices under Guild Master Henryk Ironforge.

Over the following 119 years, his career spanned the known world:

**Faerûnian Foundation (Years 1-30):**
- Waterdeep (7 years) - Guild apprenticeship and urban processing fundamentals
- Calimport (8 years) - Desert preservation and spice-curing mastery
- Suzail, Cormyr (6 years) - Court presentation and wine-preparation techniques  
- Selgaunt, Sembia (5 years) - Trade standardization and export processing
- Bezantur, Thay (4 years) - Magical creature specialization and necromantic preservation

**Kara-Tur Mastery (Years 31-60):**
- Shou Town (10 years) - Learning Eastern precision and ceremonial techniques
- Kozakura (8 years) - Blade meditation and minimal waste philosophy

**International Master Period (Years 101-119):**
- Cross-continental consulting and technique integration
- Teaching assignments at major guild centers across Toril
- Diplomatic processing for inter-cultural events
- Documentation of techniques for guild preservation

His expertise encompasses every major creature family found across Toril:

- **Field Processing**: 13 years under combat conditions across multiple climates
- **Urban Commercial**: Large-scale processing for major city markets
- **Cultural Integration**: Mastery of processing techniques from four continents  
- **Magical Specialization**: Advanced training in Thay, Halruaa, and Evereska

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

**To the masters who shaped my understanding across continents**: Particularly Guild Master Henryk Ironforge in Waterdeep, who taught me the foundation; Master Hashim al-Sakina in Calimport, who showed me that spices could preserve as well as flavor; Sensei Takeshi in Kozakura, who taught me that precision comes from patience; and Master Kekoa in Port Nyanzaru, who proved that speed and quality aren't mutually exclusive.

**To my 200+ apprentices across four continents**: Who kept me sharp by asking questions in languages I barely spoke, forcing me to demonstrate rather than lecture. Teaching across cultures taught me that good technique transcends words.

**To Helena Fairstock**: Whose *Master Provisioner's Guide* finally gave the merchant community a comprehensive reference that I could build upon rather than duplicate. Excellent work that serves butchers as well as provisioners.

**To the International Guild Council**: For maintaining standards worth maintaining across cultural boundaries and for recognizing that expertise has no homeland. Special thanks to the Faerûnian, Kozakuran, and Zakharan chapters for their support.

**To my original adventuring companions**: Who tolerated my insistence on processing everything we killed, even when we were being chased through hostile territory. Some lessons are only learned through necessity.

**To the diverse cultures of Toril**: From Calishite spice merchants who taught me preservation through flavor, to Kozakuran masters who showed me ceremony in work, to Chultan guides who proved that rapid processing could be an art form. Every tradition I learned made me better.

**To every creature I've processed across 132 years**: From common chickens in northern farms to ancient dragons in volcanic lairs. For the lessons learned, the techniques refined, and the understanding that taking a life creates responsibilities that transcend cultural boundaries.

## HOW TO READ THIS GUIDE

Each section builds on previous knowledge. While experienced butchers might skip familiar material, the mathematical formulas and yield calculations are interconnected. A principle explained in the Bovine section applies to the Equine section with minor modifications.

**Standardized Entry Format** for each animal family:

**Family Name** (examples)
**Characteristics:** Common anatomical features and processing considerations
**Size Range:** Typical size variations within the family
**Yield Patterns:** Standard percentages for major categories
**Special Considerations:** Unique processing requirements or valuable parts
**Economic Notes:** Market values, seasonal availability, regional preferences
**Safety Warnings:** Specific hazards or precautions for this family

**Processing Templates** provide mathematical formulas for:
- Live weight to dressed weight conversions
- Dressed weight to retail cut calculations
- Organ and specialty part yields
- Processing time estimates
- Tool and facility requirements

**Adaptation Notes** explain how to modify standard techniques for:
- Creature size variations
- Magical properties
- Unusual anatomy (extra limbs, different organ arrangements)
- Damage or disease affecting normal processing

## PRICING NOTES

All tool, equipment, and supply prices reference Helena Fairstock's pricing in the *Master Provisioner's Guide*. For items not covered in her guide, I use the same regional baseline:

**Waterdeep standard prices, 1492 DR**

Expect price variations based on:
- **Quality**: Professional tools cost 3-10x basic tools but last decades longer
- **Region**: Specialized equipment costs more in rural areas with limited suppliers  
- **Season**: Preservation supplies cost more during harvest season when demand peaks
- **Volume**: Bulk purchases of supplies offer 10-20% discounts
- **Relationships**: Regular customers get better prices and first access to quality tools

Equipment is expensive but essential. A professional setup requires significant investment but pays for itself through efficiency and reduced waste.

---

## WEIGHTS AND MEASURES

**Standard measures consistent with the *Master Provisioner's Guide*:**
- **Pound (lb):** Standard weight measure for all calculations
- **Ounce (oz):** 16 oz = 1 lb (used for small specialty parts)
- **Stone:** 14 lbs (traditional measure for larger animals)
- **Hundredweight:** 100 lbs (used for very large creatures)

**Processing yields are calculated as:**
- **Live Weight:** The creature as killed
- **Dressed Weight:** After initial field dressing (organs removed, blood drained)
- **Carcass Weight:** After hide/skin removal
- **Retail Weight:** Final processed cuts ready for sale

**"Processing time" calculations:**
Based on experienced butcher working with proper tools under normal conditions. Times increase significantly for:
- Apprentice skill level (+50-100%)
- Poor tools or conditions (+25-75%)
- Unusual anatomy or magical complications (+variable)
- Very large creatures (+exponential scaling)

## LEGAL DISCLAIMER

This guide provides information for legal, legitimate meat processing. I am not responsible for:

- People who ignore safety protocols and injure themselves or others
- Butchers who process prohibited species and face legal consequences  
- Anyone who uses this guide for illegal activities
- Adventurers who process random creatures without understanding local laws
- Merchants who misrepresent common meat as magical creature products

Meat processing is a legitimate, necessary profession. The techniques described here are for feeding people safely and efficiently. Keep it legal and ethical.

## SPECIAL WARNING: SENTIENT CREATURES

This guide includes technical information about processing humanoid anatomy. This knowledge serves several legitimate purposes:

- **Medical/Anatomical Education**: Understanding humanoid anatomy
- **Combat Medicine**: Treating severe injuries in humanoid allies  
- **Legal Investigation**: Understanding evidence from crimes against persons
- **Historical Documentation**: Recording techniques used in wartime or extreme survival

**However**: The processing of sentient creatures for food is illegal throughout most civilized regions and morally reprehensible. Local laws vary, but expect severe penalties for:
- Murder for the purpose of cannibalism
- Defiling humanoid remains
- Selling humanoid meat as food
- Any commercial processing of sentient species

I include this information for completeness and because knowledge itself is not evil - applications of knowledge can be. Use this information responsibly and legally.
