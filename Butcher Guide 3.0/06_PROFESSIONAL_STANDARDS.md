# PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS & SAFETY PROTOCOLS
## Universal Requirements for Competent and Legal Practice

*After 132 years across four continents, I've learned that technical skill means nothing without professional standards to guide it. The difference between a butcher and a professional butcher isn't just knowledge—it's the discipline to apply that knowledge consistently, safely, and ethically every single day. These standards protect customers, preserve reputations, and ensure that the ancient craft of butchering continues to earn respect. They apply whether you're processing a common chicken in Waterdeep or an ancient dragon in the depths of a forgotten cavern.*
